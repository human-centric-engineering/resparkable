/**
 * Hand-rolled `next/navigation` router mocks: rules.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `AppRouterInstance` gains required members between Next
 * minors (16.3.0 added `bfcacheId`), and nothing type-checks a `vi.mock`
 * factory. A test that writes the router out by hand therefore keeps compiling
 * while handing the component under test an object the real router is no longer
 * shaped like. `createMockRouter()` (`tests/types/mocks.ts`) exists so there is
 * one place to add the next member; this check is what keeps the suite going
 * through it.
 *
 * Two invariants, both across every `.ts`/`.tsx` under `tests/` (`setup.ts`,
 * `helpers/` and `mocks/` included, not only `*.test.ts`):
 *
 * 1. **No object literal supplying all six router methods.** Six members means
 *    the author meant "a complete router", which is the factory's job. A
 *    minimal stub of two or three members, for a component that reads nothing
 *    else, is deliberately fine and is not flagged.
 * 2. **No cast that switches the type check off.** `useRouter as unknown as X`
 *    is strictly worse than an uncast literal, which at least fails loudly when
 *    the interface grows.
 *
 * ## Why this parses instead of pattern-matching
 *
 * The previous implementation was a regex-and-brace-matching scanner embedded
 * in `.claude/commands/pre-pr.md`, and it reported CLEAN on a suite holding 16
 * complete literals and 17 casts. Every one of its blind spots came from not
 * having a parser:
 *
 * - It collected members with `/([A-Za-z_$][\w$]*)\s*:/`, so a **shorthand**
 *   member (`refresh,`, no colon) was never counted. Ten files wrote `refresh`
 *   that way and five wrote `push`; all sixteen read as five-of-six and passed.
 * - It **anchored** on `prefetch\s*:` to find a literal at all, so a literal
 *   whose `prefetch` was shorthand would not even have been located.
 * - Its cast rule was a `grep` for the literal string
 *   `as unknown as ReturnType<typeof useRouter>`. Every real offender writes
 *   `as unknown as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>` instead, which defeats the type
 *   check just as thoroughly.
 * - It needed a comment filter, because a JSDoc line mentioning the cast
 *   matched it.
 *
 * An AST has no such classes of bug. Shorthand is a node kind rather than a
 * spelling; `properties` is direct members only, so a nested literal cannot
 * contribute keys; comments are not nodes; and strings, template literals and
 * regex literals are single tokens, so code quoted inside them is not code.
 *
 * That last property is load-bearing for this module's own test, which holds
 * every violating shape as a template literal: the checker walking `tests/`
 * parses those as one `NoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral` and finds nothing. The
 * test needs no exemption, and a checker that has to exempt itself is the same
 * shape as the bug being fixed.
 *
 * Takes source *text*, not a path, so the rules stay testable without touching
 * the repo's real files.
