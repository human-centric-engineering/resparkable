/**
 * Hand-rolled `next/navigation` router mocks check: CLI.
 *
 * The rules, and why this is needed at all, live in `scripts/ci/router-mocks.ts`.
 * This file only walks `tests/` and hands file contents over.
 *
 * ## Why the whole tree, every time
 *
 * Deliberately repo-wide rather than scoped to a branch's diff. Both invariants
 * are meant to hold at zero, so a whole-repo count *is* the check, and a
 * diff-scoped version is blind to every pre-existing violation until someone
 * happens to re-touch those exact lines. That is not hypothetical: the first
 * version of this check was diff-scoped and could not see the files it was
 * written to catch.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run check:router-mocks
