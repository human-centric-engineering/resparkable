/**
 * Resparkable semantic-layer smoke script.
 *
 * Proves against a **real** database with **real** embeddings what mocked tests
 * cannot: that the pgvector column, the HNSW index, the generated tsvectors and
 * the hybrid SQL actually work together, and that the whole thing stays inside
 * one user's brain.
 *
 * The six things it demonstrates, in order:
 *
 *   1. capture → index → find by **meaning** rather than by matching words;
 *   2. the hash gate — a second indexing pass over unchanged rows spends nothing;
 *   3. tasks are searchable through their tsvector despite having no vectors;
 *   4. the connection sweep finds a thought-to-thought pair at zero token cost;
 *   5. archiving removes an item from vector search but not from keyword search;
 *   6. **user B never sees A's rows — including when A's row is the better
 *      vector match.** This is the assertion the plan singles out (§16.2), and
 *      the reason it needs a real database: a mocked test can only prove the
 *      query was *built* with a filter, not that the filter matches nothing.
 *
 * ## Two modes, and why the fallback matters
 *
 * With an embedding provider configured, it runs the whole stack: real vectors,
 * real semantics, `searchResparkable` end to end.
 *
 * **Without one it does not skip.** It seeds deterministic synthetic vectors
 * through the repo and runs every SQL-level assertion anyway — because the part
 * of this phase most likely to be wrong is the raw SQL (a missing `WHERE
 * "userId"`, a broken `<=>` cast, a `GROUP BY` that drops the dedupe), and none
 * of that needs a paid API to verify. What the synthetic mode cannot prove is
 * that the *embeddings* are any good; it proves the plumbing around them is.
 * The mode that ran is printed, so a green run is never mistaken for more than
 * it was.
 *
 * Skips cleanly (exit 0) only when no database is reachable. Self-cleaning:
 * creates only `smoke-resparkable-search-*` users and removes them — and, via the D1
 * cascade, everything they own — on every path.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   npm run framework:resparkable:smoke-search
 *
 * Lives under `scripts/framework/resparkable/` with a namespaced script name, because
 * `CUSTOMIZATION.md` §7 reserves the unprefixed `smoke:*` names for the platform
 * (Resparkable ask #12).
