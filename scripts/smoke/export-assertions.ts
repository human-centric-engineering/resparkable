/**
 * Whether an app subject-data section carries nothing for this subject.
 *
 * Shape-tolerant on purpose: `AppSubjectData` is `Record<string, unknown>`, so
 * a tier may return a row list, a keyed object, or nothing at all. Asserting a
 * particular shape here would invent a contract the seam does not have, and the
 * property being checked — "this subject owns none of it" — does not need one.
 *
 * Anything else (a string, a number, a boolean) counts as **not** empty, so an
 * unexpected shape is never mistaken for "nothing here".
 *
 * The leak check does NOT go through this — it tests `Array.isArray(value) &&
 * value.length > 0` directly, because only a row list can be assessed for a
 * stranger's rows. This reconciles `meta.app`'s row counts against the payload
 * the subject receives, where "is there anything in it" is the whole question.
 * An earlier version of this paragraph claimed the leak check used it.
