/**
 * Unit Tests: `buildGraph`.
 *
 * The graph's whole design is refusing to draw everything (§9): a focus is required,
 * the depth is capped at two and the node count at 150. Every assertion here is about
 * a boundary, because the failure mode is not an error — it is a page that looks fine
 * and either lies about completeness or takes a second to build.
 *
 * **Truncation is the subtle one.** A walk that stopped at the cap and a walk that ran
 * out of connections produce *identical pictures*, and mean opposite things: "there is
 * more here" versus "this is all of it". Only the walk knows, so it has to report it.
 *
 * **Edges are dropped when either end is missing.** A node excluded by the cap, or
 * unresolvable because it was archived, would otherwise leave a line drawn to nothing.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Depth 1 walks one hop; depth 2 walks two; depth is clamped to the maximum
 * - The node cap is enforced and clamped, and `truncated` is set only when it bit
 * - Running out of links leaves `truncated` false even at an exact-fit cap
 * - Edges whose ends were capped out are not returned
 * - Only accepted / suggested / proposed links are requested — never rejected
 * - Archived (unresolvable) nodes are dropped, along with their edges
 * - An unresolvable focus returns null
 * - A focus with no links at all is a valid one-node graph
 * - A type filter drops the whole edge, not half of it
 *
