/**
 * Unit Tests: `buildConnections`.
 *
 * Two decisions carry the weight here.
 *
 * **The default queue excludes rejected links.** A rejected row is the tombstone that
 * stops the sweep re-proposing a pair for ever (§17 risk 5c). Showing it in a review
 * queue would invite someone to tidy away the very rows that stop the nagging — and
 * the nagging would resume, weekly, with no obvious cause.
 *
 * **The count and the list go through the same filter.** Filtering the page in memory
 * after an unfiltered count would make "12 waiting" mean "12 links of any status, of
 * which you can see four" — a number that is wrong in a way nobody would think to
 * check.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - With no status, both the list and the count ask for suggested + proposed
 * - An explicit status wins, including `rejected` for reviewing a dismissal
 * - The kind filter is passed through
 * - Pagination reaches the repo
 * - Both ends of every row are hydrated in the batched pass
 * - The caller's scope reaches every read
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/services/connections-view.ts
