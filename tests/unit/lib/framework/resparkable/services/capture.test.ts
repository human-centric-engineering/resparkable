/**
 * Unit Tests: `captureThought`.
 *
 * Capture is the front door, and the two things that can go wrong with it are
 * both silent. A retry that creates a second row gives someone two of every
 * thought they captured on a train, and nobody notices until the inbox is full
 * of pairs. A replay that logs a second `captured` event inflates "what you got
 * done this week" in the weekly review, which reads `ResparkableEvent` rather than
 * scanning tables (§6) — so the number is wrong and there is nothing on screen
 * to suggest it.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - The space is bootstrapped before the write, because every table FKs it
 * - A new capture records exactly one `captured` event carrying the source
 * - A deduped capture records NO event, and still returns the original row
 * - `deduped` is reported to the caller, not swallowed
 * - `externalId` is omitted rather than passed as undefined when absent
 * - The scope is threaded to the repo — the isolation contract (D5)
 * - `sensitivity` is classified and threaded to the repo on every capture
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/services/capture.ts
