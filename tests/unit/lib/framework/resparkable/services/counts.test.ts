/**
 * Unit Tests: `buildCounts`.
 *
 * A badge is only worth putting on screen if it counts things that are **waiting
 * on a decision**. Include a snoozed thought and the number stops meaning
 * anything — you pushed that to Monday, so it is explicitly not waiting on you
 * (plan §10) — and a badge that counts work you have already dealt with teaches
 * people to ignore badges. Every assertion here is about which filters reach the
 * repo, because that is where "waiting on a decision" is actually defined.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Inbox counts `status: 'inbox'` thoughts with snoozed ones EXCLUDED
 * - Open tasks exclude the closed statuses AND deferred tasks
 * - Connections count is the unreviewed-links count, passed the same clock
 * - The scope is threaded to every repo call — the isolation contract (D5)
 * - The three reads are issued together rather than in series
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/services/counts.ts
