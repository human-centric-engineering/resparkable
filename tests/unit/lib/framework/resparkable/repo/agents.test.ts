/**
 * Unit Tests: `lib/framework/resparkable/repo/agents.ts` (phase 6a).
 *
 * The one repo module whose function takes no `SpaceScope`, which is exactly why
 * it needs a test that says so deliberately rather than leaving the next reader
 * to wonder whether the scope was forgotten. `AiAgent` is instance-wide
 * configuration — a model choice an operator makes in the admin UI. It has no
 * `userId` and nothing to scope by.
 *
 * The property that matters is the **null return**. Before phase 6b's seeds run
 * the Resparkable agents do not exist, and after an operator deletes one they stop
 * existing again. Every caller has to fall back to the system default rather than
 * fail, or ideation breaks on a fresh install and on a reconfigured one.
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/repo/agents.ts
