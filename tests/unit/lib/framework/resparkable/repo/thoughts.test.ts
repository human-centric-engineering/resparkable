/**
 * Unit Tests: the thought repo's `where`-clause builder.
 *
 * `thoughtWhere` is private, but it is the one function every read in this
 * file funnels through — `listThoughts` and `countThoughts` both build their
 * `where` from it, and it is a chain of five independent `...(cond ? {} : {})`
 * spreads. Each arm is invisible to a "does it run" smoke test: a mistyped
 * key, a filter that got swallowed instead of applied, or a stray
 * `createdAt: undefined` (which does NOT strip the key — Prisma treats an
 * explicit `undefined` value differently from an absent key in some paths, and
 * relying on that is exactly the kind of silent-widen bug a test should catch)
 * would still return 200 with the wrong rows, and the only witness is the
 * `where` object handed to Prisma.
 *
 * **`capturedBefore` is the priority.** It is what phase 7's morning briefing
 * uses to resurface a thought old enough that a `createdAt desc` list can
 * never reach it (§6 of the plan, see the docstring on `ThoughtFilters`). If
 * this arm silently drops — wrong key, wrong operator, `lte` instead of `lt`
 * — the briefing's "resurfaced thought" section either goes empty forever or
 * starts pulling thoughts that were never eligible, and nothing in the UI
 * would say why.
 *
 * **The owner scope is the invariant underneath all of it.** Every arm above
 * is optional; `liveSpaceWhere(scope, ...)` is not. It is asserted here on
 * every filter combination, not just the empty case, because the risk is a
 * future edit that spreads a caller-supplied object where it can clobber the
 * scope key (see `spaceWhere`'s own docstring on why spread order matters).
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - `capturedBefore` produces `createdAt: { lt: <date> }`, not `lte` or a
 *   differently-shaped comparator
 * - Omitting `capturedBefore` omits the `createdAt` key entirely — no
 *   `createdAt: undefined` silently widening the query
 * - The owner scope (`userId`, `archivedAt: null`) is present regardless of
 *   which filters are supplied, including the empty-filters case
 * - `status` and `source` are passed through literally when present, and
 *   absent (not `undefined`-keyed) when not
 * - `hideSnoozed` builds the `OR` window against "no snooze" or "snooze
 *   already elapsed", and is entirely absent when the flag is false/omitted
 *
