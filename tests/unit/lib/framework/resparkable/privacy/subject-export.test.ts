/**
 * Coverage guard: the Resparkable subject-access export vs framework-resparkable.prisma.
 *
 * This is the fork-side twin of core's `export-sources.test.ts`, and
 * `lib/app/data-export.ts` asks for it by name: *"Your tables need the same
 * protection, and core cannot write it for you — the pattern worth copying is a
 * constant listing the tables you export plus a test that greps your own schema
 * file."*
 *
 * The failure it exists to prevent is the quiet one. Adding a table to the brain
 * and forgetting this file does not break anything a user or a test would
 * notice; it just means the next subject-access request is answered with a
 * bundle that looks complete and silently omits whatever the new table held.
 * Nobody can tell from the outside — not the subject, not the operator. So the
 * guard reads the schema rather than trusting the manifest to be current.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Every model carrying a `spaceId` is exported or excluded with a reason
 * - The manifest names only models that actually exist (catches a rename)
 * - No model is both exported and excluded
 * - Exclusion reasons are substantive, not a shrug
 * - Section names are unique, so one table cannot overwrite another's data
 * - The schema scan actually finds tables (guard on the guard)
 *
 * The runtime half — that every query is owner-scoped and the inbox token is
 * omitted — is in `subject-export-behaviour.test.ts`.
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/repo/subject-export.ts
 * @see lib/app/data-export.ts
