/**
 * Unit Tests: the Resparkable workflow definitions.
 *
 * These are pure data, which is exactly why they need a test. Every mistake
 * available here is one that costs nothing at build time, passes review by
 * looking plausible, and then fails at 3am on somebody's schedule with no user
 * watching: a step naming a capability slug that does not exist, an
 * `agent_call` pointing at an unseeded agent, a `nextSteps` edge to a step id
 * that was renamed, an `entryStepId` that no longer matches.
 *
 * So this validates them the way the engine will: against the real
 * `workflowDefinitionSchema`, with the slug references resolved against the real
 * catalogue and agent list rather than against copies.
 *
 * Two properties beyond structural validity:
 *
 * **Every workflow has a cost cap.** `plan.md` §6 is explicit that a step's
 * `budgetLimitUsd` caps only that step, so a runaway run is capped by
 * `AiWorkflow.maxCostPerExecutionUsd` or by nothing — and "by nothing" is the
 * failure nobody notices until the invoice.
 *
 * **No step names a user.** The owner arrives on `execution.userId`, stamped by
 * the scheduler from `createdBy`. A userId in a step config would be a second,
 * weaker path to the same thing, and the one an LLM could influence.
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/workflows/definitions.ts
