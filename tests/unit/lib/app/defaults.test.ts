/**
 * Tests: lib/app/ seams ship as no-op defaults
 *
 * Every `lib/app/*` file is a fork-owned scaffold that Resparkable ships EMPTY. This
 * file exercises the REAL defaults to lock in that contract — a stray default
 * registration would silently apply to every install (a lint rule every fork
 * inherits, an auth email swapped out, a restricted agent's document access
 * widened).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORK NOTE — filling a seam is EXPECTED to fail a row here
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This test asserts a property every fork is expected to violate: the seams
 * exist precisely so you fill them. When you fill one, **pin the new value**
 * rather than deleting the row:
 *
 *     // BEFORE (Resparkable default)
 *     assert: () => expect(appEslintConfig).toEqual([]),
 *     // AFTER  (fork spreads its own tier config)
 *     assert: () => expect(appEslintConfig).toEqual(frameworkEslintConfig),
 *
 * Pinning keeps the protection for the seams you have NOT filled; deleting the
 * row loses it silently. The table below is the whole surface — one row per
 * seam — so a fork's diff here is a line, not a rewrite. See CUSTOMIZATION.md §4.
 *
 * FORK NOTE (Resparkable): this fork fills nine of these seams — `eslint.config.mjs`
 * (spreads the framework tier), `bootstrap.ts` (boots Resparkable), `rate-limit.ts`
 * (seven per-flow sub-caps), `capabilities.ts` (the seventeen agent tools),
 * `context-contributors.ts` (the per-turn `resparkable` context block),
 * `jobs.ts` (the connection sweep),
 * `admin-nav.ts` (the Resparkable section), `protected-routes.ts` (`/resparkable`),
 * `protected-nav.ts` and `auth-landing.ts`.
 * Each row below is pinned rather than deleted, so a stray addition to a filled
 * seam still fails. The Resparkable boot chain itself is covered by
 * tests/unit/lib/framework/resparkable/scaffold.test.ts.
 *
 * @see lib/app/ · CUSTOMIZATION.md §4
