/**
 * Coverage guard: lib/privacy/export-sources.ts vs prisma/schema/*.prisma
 *
 * This is the test issue #467 asks for. It holds the subject-access manifest
 * level with the schema, so a table that relates to `User` cannot be added
 * without someone deciding what a data subject receives from it.
 *
 * Why it has to be a *build* failure rather than a review checklist: an export
 * that omits a table looks exactly like a complete answer to the person reading
 * it. Nothing about the response reveals the gap — not to the subject, not to
 * the operator who sent it. Erasure has the mirror-image rule (a missing
 * `onDelete` throws `P2003` and breaks erasure loudly); access has no natural
 * loud failure, so this test is it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IF THIS TEST IS FAILING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * You added a model with a `userId` / `createdBy` FK to `User`. Add it to
 * `SUBJECT_DATA_SOURCES` with a disposition:
 *
 *   • `export`      — it holds the subject's own data. Use Prisma `omit` to
 *                     drop credential columns; do NOT use `select`, which
 *                     silently narrows the export every time a column is added.
 *   • `attribution` — it is org config they created. Return id + label + date.
 *
 * Deleting the row to make the test pass ships a short answer to a data
 * subject. See `.context/privacy/data-export.md`.
 *
 * @see lib/privacy/export-sources.ts

  // — through `lib/app/data-export.ts`, the seam resparkable#467 added for exactly

  // code: doing the right thing (filling the seam, writing its own completeness
  // guard — `tests/unit/lib/framework/resparkable/privacy/subject-export.test.ts`)
  // still leaves it red. Local patch to a Resparkable-owned test, same family as
  // resparkable#480 and resparkable#525. Filed as resparkable#533; ask #30 in
  // `.context/framework/resparkable/sunrise-asks.md`. Remove this block when it
