/**
 * Router-mock scanner tests: the rules.
 *
 * This file is the artefact behind an instruction the old scanner only asserted:
 * "re-test it against those shapes before trusting a CLEAN." Each shape that
 * ever defeated a version of this check has a named case below, so changing the
 * scanner cannot quietly re-open one of them.
 *
 * ## Every violating shape here lives in a template literal, on purpose
 *
 * The real checker walks `tests/`, which includes this file. A parser sees a
 * template literal as one token and emits no `ObjectLiteralExpression` inside
 * it, so these shapes are invisible to it and the checker needs no exemption
 * for its own tests, pinned by the last case in this file.
 *
 * **Never write a bare six-member router literal, or a `useRouter` cast, in
 * this file's own TypeScript.** It would be a real violation, and the checker
 * would be right to flag it.
 *
 * @see scripts/ci/router-mocks.ts
