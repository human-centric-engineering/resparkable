/**
 * Unit Tests: a core artifact that reads a fork seam has to say so
 *
 * The recurring defect behind #480, #525, #530 and #533 is one shape: **a core
 * artifact measures something a `lib/app/*` seam contributes to, so filling the
 * seam correctly turns the suite red.** #480 closed it for one file with the
 * `SEAM_DEFAULTS` pin table, and v0.8.0 then shipped a brand-new instance in
 * `scripts/smoke/export.ts`. A fix to one file is not a rule anyone can check,
 * so the next artifact re-derives the same wrong assumption and the next fork
 * finds it.
 *
 * This is the checkable part of that rule: any file under `tests/` or
 * `scripts/` that reads a `lib/app/*` module **without mocking it** must carry
 * a `FORK NOTE` saying what a fork should expect. Reading the real seam is
 * often right — that is what `defaults.test.ts` is for — but it makes the file
 * a fork's problem, and the note is what turns a mystifying failure into an
 * instruction.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH — measured, not assumed
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The four artifacts that motivated the rule were checked against it. It would
 * have caught **one**:
 *
 *   • `defaults.test.ts` (#480) — imports the seams directly. CAUGHT.
 *   • `registry.test.ts` (#525) — counts registrations through
 *     `registerBuiltInCapabilities()`, which calls the seam. No reference here
 *     at all: the coupling is transitive. MISSED.
 *   • `export-sources.test.ts` (#533) — scans `prisma/schema/`, a fork-reserved
 *     *directory*, and never imports a seam. MISSED.
 *   • `scripts/smoke/export.ts` (#530) — asserts on `bundle.app`, a key the
 *     seam fills two calls away. MISSED.
 *   • The eleven `/dashboard` assertions (#530) — restate a seam's default
 *     *value*, with no reference to anything. MISSED.
 *
 * A grep cannot see "this assertion's value depends on what a fork
 * contributes", because that is a semantic property with no syntax. What does
 * see it is filling every seam and running the suite — the failures are the
 * roster, exactly, with no false positives. That sweep is worth building and is
 * filed as #636; this file is the cheap half, and it is documented here so
 * nobody mistakes it for the whole rule.
 *
 * @see tests/unit/lib/app/defaults.test.ts — the pin table this generalises
 * @see CUSTOMIZATION.md §4
