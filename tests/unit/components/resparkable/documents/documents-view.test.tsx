/**
 * DocumentsView Component Tests
 *
 * Ingestion is asynchronous in effect: a document is parsed, chunked and embedded,
 * and until that finishes it is **not findable by meaning**. A list showing only
 * titles would leave someone searching for a document they uploaded two minutes ago
 * and concluding search is broken. So status is first-class here, and the copy says
 * what each status means for finding the thing.
 *
 * The download button is gated on `hasOriginal` rather than rendered hopefully. The
 * list endpoint strips `storageKey` and returns that boolean instead, because whether
 * an original exists depends on a deployment-wide operator setting and on whether the
 * storage provider can read objects back at all — and discarding originals is the
 * default. An ungated button would 404 for most deployments.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Each status is rendered as what it means, not as its enum value
 * - A processing document is described as not yet searchable
 * - An errored document shows the parser's own reason
 * - Passage counts appear only once indexing has finished
 * - The download button appears only when an original was retained
 * - Byte sizes are human-readable
 * - Archived documents are badged
 * - The empty state explains what uploading does
 *
 * @see components/resparkable/documents/documents-view.tsx
