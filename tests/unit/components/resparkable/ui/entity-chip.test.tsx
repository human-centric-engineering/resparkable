/**
 * EntityChip Component Tests
 *
 * `ResparkableLink` has no foreign keys to its endpoints — it is polymorphic by
 * design (D2) — so a link pointing at a row that has since been deleted is a
 * NORMAL state, not a corruption. `buildInbox` says so explicitly and resolves
 * such a target to `null`. This component is where that decision becomes visible:
 * a dangling edge must render as inert text, never as a link to a 404.
 *
 * The second thing worth pinning is the colour/href map itself. Five surfaces
 * (search, inbox, connections, graph, card links) render these chips, and the
 * graph reads the same map for its node colours — so a node and its chip cannot
 * disagree about what a goal looks like.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - A resolved project / entity chip links to that item's own page
 * - A `null` label renders "(deleted)" as plain text with NO link
 * - Types with no page of their own (thought, task) render unlinked even when
 *   the label resolves — they are opened from a list or a sheet, not a route
 * - An unknown type degrades to a neutral chip instead of throwing, so adding a
 *   type server-side cannot blank a page
 * - `compact` hides the type word but keeps the label
 * - GRAPH_NODE_COLOURS is derived from the same table, one entry per type
 *
 * @see components/resparkable/ui/entity-chip.tsx
