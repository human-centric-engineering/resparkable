/**
 * PriorityExplainer Component Tests
 *
 * This component's whole reason to exist is that a bare score is worse than
 * useless: the first time the ranking is wrong, "0.62" reads as the tool being
 * broken rather than as a judgement the user can override (plan §10).
 *
 * The invariant worth protecting is that it **reports** rather than **recomputes**.
 * `priorityFactors` is written by the pure scorer at the same moment as the number
 * (D3), and an expired boost already arrives as `manualBoost: 0` with
 * `boostActive: false`. A component that checked the expiry date itself would
 * eventually disagree with the column beside it — invisibly. The "expired" test
 * below pins that: given a boost value with `boostActive: false`, the UI must say
 * it is no longer applied, without being told a date.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - A null / unparseable `priorityFactors` renders "Not yet ranked", not a crash
 *   or an empty popover — a task created before its first scoring pass is a real
 *   state
 * - An unknown extra field does NOT break parsing (the schema is deliberately not
 *   strict, so rows scored by an older build still explain themselves)
 * - The dominant factor is named in plain English, not camelCase
 * - An active positive boost reads as "Pinned by you"; a negative one as pushed down
 * - An EXPIRED boost reports "expired, no longer applied"
 * - A deferred task says so and explains that a pin will not bring it back early
 * - `returnedFromSnooze` is surfaced, since silent reappearance is the failure
 * - The stored boost reason is shown when there is one
 *
