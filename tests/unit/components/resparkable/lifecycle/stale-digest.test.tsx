/**
 * Component Tests: the stale digest surface.
 *
 * The digest is one screen where the *copy and the weighting* are the feature.
 * §11 asks for two things that a rendering test is the only place to hold:
 *
 * **Every row is a question with three answers and no default**, and "still
 * live" is the prominent one. Most things that have gone quiet still matter — a
 * client you have not billed this quarter, a goal you are behind on — so a
 * screen that made *archive* the obvious button would nudge people into tidying
 * away things they care about, and the bluntness §11 wants belongs in the
 * question rather than in the weighting of the answers.
 *
 * **Areas offer no "still live" button.** An area has no `lastActivityAt` to
 * stamp, so a button there would write a field nothing reads and silently fail
 * to make the row go away. The row says what to do instead.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - An empty digest says so rather than rendering four empty headings
 * - Sections with no rows are omitted; sections with rows render each one
 * - "Quiet for N days" for a row with a signal; different wording for one without
 * - "Still live" posts the type and id, and refreshes rather than hiding the row
 * - Areas render no "still live" button, and say what to do instead
 * - An unknown section type still renders its rows rather than dropping them
 *
