/**
 * GoalsView Component Tests
 *
 * The tree is the content: a flat list of goals says nothing about which serves
 * which. Two things about building it are easy to get wrong and lose data on screen.
 *
 * **Orphans.** A goal whose parent was archived or deleted is unreachable from any
 * root, so a naive "roots are the ones with no parentGoalId" render would silently
 * drop it — the goal still exists, still affects ranking, and simply cannot be seen.
 * Anything whose parent is not in the rendered set is therefore treated as a root.
 *
 * **The overdue multiplier.** A goal past its target date has its pull on tasks cut
 * by 30%. That is deliberate, and completely invisible: the tasks beneath it just
 * quietly rank lower. The row says so.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Children nest under their parent, and roots render at the top level
 * - A goal whose parent is absent is still rendered rather than dropped
 * - A goal cannot be offered as its own parent in the edit form
 * - Past-due active goals are flagged, with the "counting for less" explanation
 * - An achieved goal past its date is NOT flagged — it is finished, not late
 * - Horizons render, and roots are ordered nearest-horizon first
 * - The empty state explains what goals do to the ranking
 *
