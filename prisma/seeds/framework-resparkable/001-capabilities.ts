/**
 * Seed the thirteen `AiCapability` rows.
 *
 * **The rows are written from the catalogue, never typed out here.** A
 * capability lives in three places — a TypeScript handler, this row, and the
 * JSON function definition the model is actually steered by — and only the third
 * is what changes the agent's behaviour. A hand-copied definition that drifts
 * from the class does not fail: the tool keeps working while the model is told
 * about a parameter that no longer exists. Reading
 * `lib/framework/resparkable/capabilities/catalogue.ts` makes drift impossible
 * rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * **Re-seed behaviour follows the code-owned / operator-owned split #545
 * made explicit for every capability seed.** The update branch rewrites
 * `functionDefinition`, `executionType` and `executionHandler` — code
 * artefacts: the handler class name must match a registration that only this
 * repo controls, and a stale function definition is the silent failure
 * described above. It does NOT rewrite `name`, `description` or `category` —
 * the model reads its name and description from inside `functionDefinition`,
 * not these columns, so they are free for an operator to retitle in the admin
 * UI without a redeploy reverting it. Also not rewritten: `isActive`,
 * `rateLimit`, `requiresApproval`, `quarantineState`. Turning a tool off in
 * the admin UI keeps it off.
 *
 * Bindings live in `004-agent-capabilities`. A capability row with no binding is
 * registered and callable by nobody, which is the correct default for anything
 * that writes.
