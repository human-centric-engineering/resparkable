/**
 * Bind capabilities to agents — the fourth and last step of the pipeline.
 *
 * **This table is where the agents' instructions become enforcement.** The
 * triage prompt says "never create a project or a goal"; that sentence is
 * advice, and a model having a bad day ignores advice. The absent
 * `resparkable_upsert_project` binding is the part that actually holds: the chat
 * handler advertises only the capabilities an agent has an enabled row for, and
 * refuses any tool name outside that advertised set before dispatch. Every "do
 * not" in an agent's instructions that *could* be a missing binding is one here.
 *
 * **`resparkable-judge` is bound to nothing, and that is asserted rather than
 * assumed.** A judge scores; it does not act. Zero rows means zero advertised
 * tools, so there is no path from a scoring prompt to a write. It matters enough
 * to have its own test, because the failure mode is someone adding "just search"
 * to make a rubric better and quietly giving a scorer a tool loop.
 *
 * **Revoking is `isEnabled: false`, never deleting the row.** A missing pivot
 * row synthesizes a default-ALLOW binding in the dispatcher (see
 * `getAgentBinding`), so the intuitive way to withdraw a capability is the one
 * that widens it on the workflow path. This seed therefore *updates* rows it
 * finds rather than deleting and recreating them, and leaves `isEnabled` alone —
 * an operator who turned a tool off in the admin UI keeps it off across deploys.
