/**
 * PublicSection — the marketing pages' one layout unit.
 *
 * **Fork-owned.** Lives under `components/marketing/resparkable/` rather than in
 * `components/marketing/` itself: that directory is platform-maintained and
 * keeps improving upstream, so anything named after this product goes in a
 * subfolder upstream will never write to.
 *
 * ## The two-column rail
 *
 * The heading does not sit above the content, it sits *beside* it — a sticky
 * four-column rail on the left, eight columns of substance on the right. Two
 * reasons, and neither is decoration:
 *
 * 1. **Martian Mono cannot carry a wide heading.** `h1`/`h2` take the display
 *    font automatically, and it sprawls past about six words at full width. A
 *    third of the viewport is a hard measure that keeps every heading short by
 *    construction rather than by review.
 * 2. **The label stays on screen while you read past it.** These sections are
 *    long lists of specifics; a heading that has scrolled away leaves the reader
 *    holding a fact with nothing to attach it to.
 *
 * Below `lg` the rail collapses to a stacked heading and everything reads in
 * order. No sticky, because a sticky block on a phone spends the screen it is
 * trying to save.
 *
 * ## Why sections have no background
 *
 * The page runs `.obsidian-field`, and the grid is the alignment reference every
 * column here is set against. Banding alternate sections would cover it and put
 * the layout back on the reader's word rather than the page's. Separation is one
 * hairline `border-t` instead — the same line the app draws between panels.
