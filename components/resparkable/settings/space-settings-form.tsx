/**
 * SpaceSettingsForm — the settings that change how the brain behaves.
 *
 * ## Timezone is the one that is silently wrong until it isn't
 *
 * Every snooze preset, every retention window and every "tomorrow at 9am" resolves in
 * `ResparkableSpace.timezone`, never in server time. The default is `UTC`, so a user who
 * never opens this page has every scheduling gesture landing at the wrong hour — a
 * task that unsnoozes at 2am because the server is in UTC is exactly the small
 * wrongness §10 calls careless. It is therefore the first field, and the copy says
 * what it governs.
 *
 * ## The weights must sum to 1, and the form enforces it
 *
 * `base` is a weighted average and the plan guarantees it lands in `[0, 1]` — which is
 * the entire reason a `manualBoost` of `+1` provably outranks every unboosted task
 * (§10). Weights summing to 1.4 break that guarantee, and the symptom is a pin that
 * doesn't pin, discovered months later. The API refuses it; this form shows the
 * running total so nobody has to submit to find out.
 *
 * There is deliberately no weekly-hours field on this card: Resparkable does not
 * ask how many hours a week anyone has (`design-principles.md`).
 *
 * ## The connection floor is model-dependent, which is why it is a setting
 *
 * Phase 4 shipped with the plan's 0.72 and the engine proposed nothing at all —
 * against the default embedding model that threshold sits above the signal. 0.55 is
 * the measured replacement. Anyone on a different model needs a different number, and
 * a sweep that is mis-tuned produces exactly the same output as a sweep that found
 * nothing.

                  to find.
