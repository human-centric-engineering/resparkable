/**
 * ResparkableChat — the conversational surface at `/resparkable/chat`.
 *
 * ## Why this is not Resparkable's `<ChatInterface>`
 *
 * That component is genuinely reusable and does more than this one, but it posts
 * to `API.ADMIN.ORCHESTRATION.CHAT_STREAM` as a hardcoded constant — there is no
 * prop for the endpoint. Reusing it would mean editing a Resparkable-owned file,
 * which is the one thing this tier does not do (filed upstream as
 * https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/526).
 *
 * The forced rebuild turned out to be the right shape anyway. Most of what the
 * admin component carries is admin-only: per-turn cost, token breakdowns, the
 * tool-argument trace strip. On a personal brain the trace strip would render
 * the user's own note text back through a surface with different redaction
 * rules, and the cost readout would put a price tag on thinking out loud.
 *
 * ## What it does show
 *
 * **Which tools ran.** A capability chip under each assistant turn — "searched
 * your brain", "captured a thought". Not decoration: this agent can write, and
 * an assistant that quietly created three tasks while answering a question is
 * the thing people stop trusting. Naming the writes is cheaper than an approval
 * gate and catches the same class of surprise.
 *
 * ## Streaming contract
 *
 * `fetch` + `ReadableStream`, not `EventSource` — the request is a POST and
 * `EventSource` cannot send a body. Frames are parsed by the platform's own
 * `parseChatStreamEvent`, imported rather than reimplemented: it is the wire
 * contract, and a second copy of that Zod union is a second thing to keep in
 * step with the handler.
 *
 * The in-flight request is aborted on unmount. Raw error text never reaches the
 * DOM — `getUserFacingError` maps a code to a sentence.
