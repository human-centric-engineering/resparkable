/**
 * The morning briefing, on Today.
 *
 * ## It reads; it does not generate
 *
 * The briefing is written overnight by `resparkable-morning-briefing` and this
 * fetches the stored row. `plan.md` §6 is emphatic about why: waiting twenty
 * seconds after pressing a button is a bad experience, and the inputs barely
 * change between 3am and 8am. So the ordinary path here costs one indexed read
 * and no model call at all.
 *
 * ## Staleness is shown, not hidden
 *
 * If the overnight run did not happen, the newest stored briefing is from an
 * earlier day. Rendering it silently would be the component telling a small lie
 * every morning until someone noticed. So the generated-at time is always
 * visible, and past the staleness window it is called out and regeneration is
 * offered — §6's "a stale briefing should look stale rather than lying quietly".
 *
 * ## Regeneration is deliberately the slow path
 *
 * `POST /briefing/regenerate` queues a workflow run for the maintenance tick
 * rather than running it inline, so nothing here can await a result. The button
 * therefore reports that it has asked, and the page picks the new briefing up on
 * its next load. Pretending otherwise, a spinner that resolves to nothing, would
 * be worse than saying what actually happened.
 *
 * ## The share control, and what had to exist first
 *
 * A briefing is a `ResparkableReview` row and `review` is one of §13's six
 * shareable types, so a button here is the obvious move. It was written, taken
 * out, and put back, and the round trip is worth recording because the reason
 * was never about this component.
 *
 * `createReview` is a `create`, never an update, so tomorrow this card renders
 * a **different row**. A link minted on today's briefing then points at a row
 * this card no longer shows, and while `ShareDialog` was only reachable through
 * an entity's own control that link could not be revoked by anything. Granting
 * is not the hard half; being able to take it back is, and a share nobody can
 * revoke is not a share, it is a publication.
 *
 * `/resparkable/sharing` is what fixed it: an inventory keyed on the **share**
 * rather than the entity, so a share outliving the surface that made it is
 * still listed and still closable. That was worth building for its own sake,
 * because archiving any item does the same thing, and a briefing is only the
 * fastest way to reach the state. See
 * [`sharing.md`](../../../.context/framework/resparkable/sharing.md).
