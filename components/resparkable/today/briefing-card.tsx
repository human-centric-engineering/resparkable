/**
 * The morning briefing, on Today.
 *
 * ## It reads; it does not generate
 *
 * The briefing is written overnight by `resparkable-morning-briefing` and this
 * fetches the stored row. `plan.md` §6 is emphatic about why: waiting twenty
 * seconds after pressing a button is a bad experience, and the inputs barely
 * change between 3am and 8am. So the ordinary path here costs one indexed read
 * and no model call at all.
 *
 * ## Staleness is shown, not hidden
 *
 * If the overnight run did not happen, the newest stored briefing is from an
 * earlier day. Rendering it silently would be the component telling a small lie
 * every morning until someone noticed. So the generated-at time is always
 * visible, and past the staleness window it is called out and regeneration is
 * offered — §6's "a stale briefing should look stale rather than lying quietly".
 *
 * ## Regeneration is deliberately the slow path
 *
 * `POST /briefing/regenerate` queues a workflow run for the maintenance tick
 * rather than running it inline, so nothing here can await a result. The button
 * therefore reports that it has asked, and the page picks the new briefing up on
 * its next load. Pretending otherwise, a spinner that resolves to nothing, would
 * be worse than saying what actually happened.
 *
 * ## This is where a `review` is shared from
 *
 * A briefing is a `ResparkableReview` row, and `review` is one of §13's six
 * shareable types. It is also the only stored review the owner has a surface
 * for, so the share control lives here: the tier has no reviews list and does
 * not need one to make the type shareable. Regenerating writes a **new** row
 * rather than editing this one, which matters for anything already shared. The
 * grant names a row, so a share stays pointed at the briefing that was shared
 * and a new one is not silently published to whoever held the old link.
