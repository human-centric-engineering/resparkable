/**
 * GraphView — a neighbourhood of the brain, laid out and drawn.
 *
 * ## Two libraries, each doing only what it is good at
 *
 * `@xyflow/react` renders nodes and edges, handles panning, zooming and hit-testing.
 * What it does **not** do is decide where anything goes — it expects x/y coordinates.
 * `d3-force` does exactly that and nothing else (~30 KB). Running the simulation in
 * an effect and writing the settled positions into React Flow nodes is the whole
 * integration.
 *
 * Not `elkjs`: a multi-megabyte Java-transpiled layout engine built for hierarchical
 * diagrams, which is the wrong shape for an associative graph and the wrong weight
 * for a page you open casually (§9).
 *
 * ## The simulation is run to completion, not animated
 *
 * `simulation.tick()` in a loop rather than letting it run on a timer. An animated
 * settle looks impressive for two seconds and then costs a frame budget forever on a
 * page people leave open; running 300 ticks synchronously and rendering the result
 * gives the same layout with no ongoing cost. It also means the picture is stable —
 * nodes are where they were when you looked away.
 *
 * ## What the styling encodes
 *
 * - **Colour by type**, from the same table the chips use, so the graph is a legend
 *   for the rest of the UI rather than its own vocabulary.
 * - **Dashed edges for suggestions.** A proposal is not a fact, and drawing them
 *   identically would be the graph asserting things nobody agreed to.
 * - **Thickness by `strength`**, so a strong similarity reads as one.
 * - **The focus node is larger and ringed**, because "where am I" is the first
 *   question a neighbourhood view has to answer.
 *
 * Clicking a node **re-centres the query** rather than re-laying-out what is already
 * on screen: the point is to walk the graph, and each step is a new, bounded
 * neighbourhood rather than an ever-growing hairball.
