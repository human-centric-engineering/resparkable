/**
 * PinControl — the human veto over the scorer.
 *
 * ## Why a pin, and why it expires
 *
 * The six factors handle "what should generally matter". They cannot handle "I
 * don't care what the maths says, *this* one first", which is a real and frequent
 * need — and without it the ranking loses credibility the first time it is wrong
 * (`plan.md` §10).
 *
 * The expiry is what keeps it honest. A pin set in March and forgotten silently
 * corrupts the ranking for ever, and you would never know the maths had stopped
 * being followed. So the duration picker offers today / this week / until I
 * unpin, and the last one is a deliberate choice rather than the default.
 *
 * ## Negative pins are a feature
 *
 * "Bury this — I can't delete it but I don't want to see it" is the other half of
 * the same gesture, and it costs nothing to offer. It is the reason the list
 * doesn't fill with undeletable noise.
 *
 * ## No agent may write this
 *
 * No capability exposes `manualBoost` and `resparkable_reprioritise` never touches it.
 * This control, and `PATCH /resparkable/tasks/[id]`, are the only paths. That is the
 * point: a machine writing the human's override defeats the override.
 *
 * ## Where the reason lives, and why not here
 *
 * §10 wants `manualBoostReason` visible so an overridden ranking reads as a
 * decision rather than an anomaly. That happens in two places: `PriorityExplainer`
 * renders it wherever a score is shown, and the task form / card detail sheet let
 * you write it. It is deliberately **not** in this menu — these controls sit one
 * per row in dense lists, and putting a text field behind a row-level dropdown
 * means nesting a popover inside a menu, which nests one focus trap inside
 * another and breaks the keyboard path. A pin is a one-click gesture; annotating
 * it is an edit, and edits belong in the form.
 *
 * ## One deviation from the snooze rule, deliberately
 *
 * `SnoozeMenu` never computes an instant — presets resolve server-side in the
 * user's timezone, because something *happens* at that moment and it must happen
 * at the same moment from every client. A boost expiry is different: nothing
 * fires, no job runs, the scorer simply stops adding the boost once the timestamp
 * has passed (§10 — read at evaluation time, never lazily zeroed). So the coarse
 * client-side date below is safe, and it avoids inventing a `/boost` endpoint for
 * a field the plan says moves only by PATCH. If that ever stops being true, the
 * fix is a server-resolved endpoint, not a timezone guess here.
