/**
 * EmptyState — what a surface says before it has anything in it.
 *
 * This gets its own component because a second brain is *entirely* empty on day
 * one and stays partly empty for weeks: no goals until you write some, no
 * connections until the sweep has vectors to compare, no documents until you
 * upload one. Nine surfaces hitting that state with nine different phrasings is
 * how a tool starts feeling unfinished.
 *
 * The rule the props encode: **an empty state names the next action.** "No
 * projects yet" is a status message; "No projects yet — create one and its tasks
 * start being ranked" tells you why you would. The `action` slot is optional
 * only because a few states are genuinely nothing-to-do (an empty inbox is a
 * success, not a prompt).
