/**
 * ResparkableSidekick — the full-height capture drawer that rides alongside every
 * Resparkable page.
 *
 * ## Why it overlays instead of taking a column
 *
 * It used to be an 18rem card in a two-column grid, which cost every page a fifth
 * of its width permanently in exchange for a two-row textarea. That is the wrong
 * trade twice over: the board, the graph and the day planner are all width-hungry
 * surfaces being squeezed by a control nobody is using most of the time, and when
 * you *are* using it, two rows is not enough room to think in.
 *
 * So the panel is `fixed` and the page beneath it is full width. Opening the
 * drawer changes nothing about the layout underneath — no reflow, no column
 * collapse, no board re-wrapping mid-drag. It slides over, you write, it slides
 * back.
 *
 * ## Why it is not modal, but does get out of the way
 *
 * A sidekick you can only use with the rest of the app frozen is a dialog wearing
 * a different shape. There is no focus trap and, above `sm`, no backdrop: you can
 * read the project you are writing about while you write about it, and the panel
 * stays put across navigations because it is state, not a moment.
 *
 * Pointing at anything else closes it, and — this is the part worth keeping — the
 * click still reaches whatever you pointed at. A dismissing overlay that eats the
 * first click is the thing that makes drawers feel like obstacles: you go for a
 * task, the drawer closes, and you have to go for it again. Here the drawer
 * closing is a side effect of the click you already meant to make.
 *
 * Anything left in the box survives being closed — the component stays mounted —
 * so a half-written thought is not the price of clicking away.
 *
 * ## Why the width is draggable and remembered
 *
 * "Pull it out over the content" is a different gesture from "open it": one is
 * for a sentence, the other is for pasting in a page of meeting notes and cutting
 * it down. The drag handle covers the whole range, the maximise button jumps
 * between the two ends for people who would rather not aim, and both the width
 * and the open state persist — a preference you have to re-express on every page
 * load is not a preference.
 *
 * The width lives in local state *during* a drag and is committed to
 * `localStorage` on release, because writing to storage on every pointermove is a
 * synchronous serialize per frame.
 *
 * ## Keyboard
 *
 * `⌘/Ctrl+K` opens the drawer and lands the caret in the box — the shortcut lives
 * here rather than in `QuickCapture` because it has to be able to open the thing
 * the textarea is inside. `Escape` closes. The drag handle is a real
 * `role="separator"` with arrow-key resizing, so the width is reachable without a
 * pointer.
