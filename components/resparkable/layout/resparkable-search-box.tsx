/**
 * ResparkableSearchBox — the persistent search field in the Resparkable header.
 *
 * ## Why it navigates instead of searching in place
 *
 * Every keystroke-triggered search would be an embedding call. `searchResparkable`
 * embeds the query before it can rank anything, so type-ahead here would spend a
 * paid API call per character and burn the 30/min sub-cap in about four words.
 * The box therefore submits — `Enter` or the button — and the results page owns
 * the request. That is also why the search route is deliberately not ETag'd.
 *
 * ## The query never goes anywhere except the URL
 *
 * No analytics, no logging, no local storage of recent searches. The search route
 * makes this point in its own header: the query is the single most sensitive
 * string a user hands this product — "am I being made redundant", "divorce
 * solicitor" — and a stored recent-searches list is a copy of that sitting in the
 * browser of a shared laptop. The URL is unavoidable; anything beyond it is a
 * choice, and the choice here is no.
 *
 * ## `size`
 *
 * `'default'` is the box the full-width layout has always rendered — its
 * classes are untouched, so nothing currently on screen moves. `'compact'`
 * exists for Phase 6's slim, sticky `ResparkableAppHeader`, which has about
 * 32px of height to work with rather than a page's worth; same submit
 * behaviour, smaller input and icon.
