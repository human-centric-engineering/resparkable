/**
 * SectionHeader — the section's name, its one-line blurb, and the ⓘ that
 * explains where its contents come from.
 *
 * It carries the page's `h1`. The shell above it no longer prints "Resparkable" as a
 * title — the app nav says that already, and the heading a reader needs is the
 * one that changes between routes.
 *
 * ## Why this is in the shell rather than on thirteen pages
 *
 * The shell is the only place that renders on every route, so putting it here is
 * what makes the guarantee "every area has an explanation" true by construction
 * rather than by everyone remembering. A page added next month gets a header the
 * moment it gets an entry in `section-help.ts`, and a page whose author forgot is
 * visibly missing one rather than silently unexplained.
 *
 * It is a client component only because the copy is chosen by `pathname`, which a
 * server layout cannot see. Nothing is fetched.
 *
 * ## Why an unknown route renders nothing
 *
 * A route with no entry gets no header at all — no placeholder, no "no help
 * available". Half a header is worse than none: it makes the absence look like a
 * loading state rather than a gap someone should fill.
 *
 * ## `href`
 *
 * Defaults to `usePathname()` — the single-page layout this component was
 * built for has exactly one route on screen, so the browser's own URL is
 * the right lookup key. The workspace shell (Phase 8) can show several tabs
 * at once, each wanting its *own* header regardless of which one happens to
 * match the current URL — `WorkspacePane` passes each tab's own route
 * (`buildRouteForTab(tab.kind, tab.params)`) explicitly rather than relying
 * on the browser's address bar, which only ever agrees with one tab in the
 * whole tree.

          Deliberately not the word "Resparkable": the rail head and the app nav both
          say that already, and printing it a third time is the duplication this
          shell removed once before. The group is the one piece of orientation
          the page doesn't otherwise carry — on a deep link into `/resparkable/areas`
          it tells you where you landed without a breadcrumb's worth of chrome.

          The `▍` is what makes this read as a terminal rather than as a page with
          a monospace heading: it is a prompt, and the section name is the thing
          it was asked for. `aria-hidden` and a sibling rather than part of the
          string, so a screen reader says "Organise" and not "vertical bar
          Organise". Rendered only when a group is found, since an orphaned block
          reads as a rendering fault. */}
