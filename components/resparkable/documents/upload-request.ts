/**
 * The one function in Resparkable that sends a file, extracted so the two surfaces
 * that do it — the Documents page and the capture sidekick — cannot drift.
 *
 * ## Why `XMLHttpRequest` rather than `fetch`
 *
 * `apiClient` is the right tool for JSON and the wrong one here. `fetch` has no
 * upload-progress event — the browser gives you no way to observe a request body
 * being sent — and a 20 MB PDF over a slow connection takes long enough that "is
 * this working?" is a fair question. XHR's `upload.onprogress` is the only API
 * that answers it.
 *
 * A spinner would be the alternative and it would be a lie: it says "something is
 * happening" while telling you nothing about whether it will finish this minute
 * or this hour.
 *
 * ## Dedupe and failure are reported honestly
 *
 * The endpoint returns **200 with `meta.deduped`** when the same bytes have been
 * uploaded before, and 201 when it actually created something. Reporting both as
 * "uploaded" would leave someone believing they have two copies of a document,
 * and then wondering why deleting one leaves the other.
 *
 * `ingestDocument` rejects an unsupported format, an empty scan or a minified
 * blob with a 400 and a specific reason. Those messages are written for the
 * person who chose the file, so they are surfaced verbatim rather than replaced
 * with "upload failed".
 *
 * The returned promise **resolves** on failure rather than rejecting: every
 * caller has to render the reason anyway, and a rejection would make each of
 * them write the same try/catch to get back to the same string.
