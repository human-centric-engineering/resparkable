/**
 * Transfer policy for the core and orchestration tables.
 *
 * The brain's own tables are classified one tier down, in
 * `lib/framework/resparkable/transfer/policy.ts`; a fork's are in
 * `lib/app/data-transfer.ts`. This file covers everything else — auth, agents,
 * workflows, knowledge, evaluations, MCP, and the platform's own bookkeeping.
 *
 * ## Three recurring decisions, made once here
 *
 * **Credentials never move.** Sessions, OAuth tokens, password hashes and API
 * key hashes are `skip`. A key hash is not a record *about* a key — it is the
 * thing the server compares against, so importing one would make the old key
 * work in the new environment. That is the difference between exporting a
 * password and exporting the ability to log in.
 *
 * **Anything that can act on its own arrives switched off.** Webhooks, event
 * hooks, schedules and triggers transfer, but with their secrets cleared and
 * their enabled flags forced false. This generalises the rule the orchestration
 * backup importer already applies to webhooks: a bundle should never be able to
 * start making outbound requests from an account the moment it lands.
 *
 * **History is `export-only`.** Executions, runs, audit logs and cost records go
 * into the bundle — they are the user's record and they are owed it — but they
 * are never written back. Re-importing them would manufacture provenance:
 * an execution trace in a new environment describing a run that never happened
 * there, sitting alongside real ones and indistinguishable from them.
 *
 * @see lib/portability/policy.ts — what each field means
 * @see lib/privacy/export-sources.ts — the Art. 15 manifest this deliberately differs from
 */
