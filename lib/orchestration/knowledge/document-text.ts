/**
 * Rebuild a document's text from its stored chunks.
 *
 * Needed because `originalContent` and `processedContent` are cleared once a
 * document is chunked and embedded — a cleanup document otherwise holds two
 * full copies of itself forever — so the chunk rows are the only surviving
 * copy of the text of a finished document.
 *
 * ORDERING. Chunks have no index column; document order lives in the numeric
 * suffix of `chunkKey` (`…-my-section-12`). The rest of the codebase sorts by
 * `chunkKey` lexicographically, which is fine for a list but is NOT document
 * order — it sorts by the section slug first, and `-10` before `-2`. Rebuilding
 * text needs true order, so the suffix is parsed and sorted numerically, with
 * the lexicographic key as a stable tie-break for any row whose key does not
 * end in a number.
 *
 * FIDELITY. This is the INGESTED text, not the source file: the chunker can
 * drop a fragment that fits no chunk, which is exactly what the Coverage
 * column reports. Callers should label the result as rebuilt rather than
 * presenting it as the original.
