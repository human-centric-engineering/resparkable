/**
 * Conversation access authorization
 *
 * Single source of truth for "can this admin view this conversation?".
 * Every conversation route — list, detail, messages, provenance, export —
 * gates through this helper rather than hand-rolling its own check.
 *
 * The rule is simple: an admin can view a conversation iff
 *
 *   1. They own it (`AiConversation.userId === adminUserId`), OR
 *   2. The owner has created an active share record, OR
 *   3. Nobody owns it (`userId IS NULL`) — an inbound thread (SMS,
 *      WhatsApp, email, Slack) belongs to the deployment, not to a person.
 *
 * "Active" means: `revokedAt IS NULL AND (expiresAt IS NULL OR expiresAt > now())`.
 *
 * **Why the `'system'` basis exists.** Inbound conversations used to be
 * stamped with the operator who configured the trigger, which made a third
 * party's messages look like that operator's personal data: erasing them
 * cascade-deleted the correspondence, and a subject-access export disclosed
 * it. #502 nulled the column. A null owner matches no admin, so without this
 * basis every inbound thread would drop out of the admin UI entirely — no
 * list entry, no transcript, and no way to delete one when the person who
 * sent the messages asks you to.
 *
 * The person on the other end of an inbound thread is a data subject with no
 * account here, so nothing about `'system'` access is routine: it is logged
 * exactly like `'shared'`.
 *
 * The helper is a pure read — no audit log writes happen here. Callers
 * decide whether to log:
 *
 *   - `basis === 'owner'`: routine self-access, skip logging.
 *   - `basis === 'shared'` / `'system'`: access to data that is not the
 *     caller's own, ALWAYS log via `logConversationAccess` (see
 *     `lib/orchestration/audit/admin-audit-logger.ts`).
 *
 * The `ownerId` field is surfaced so callers can record the conversation's
 * owner on the audit row without an extra DB round-trip.
 *
 * Future extension: when a `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER` role lands, this helper
 * will grow a third basis (`'compliance'`) that bypasses the share check
 * for documented-legal-basis access. The audit-of-audits requirements for
 * that path are stricter (mandatory justification text, user
 * notification); the helper signature can absorb that without callers
 * needing to change.
