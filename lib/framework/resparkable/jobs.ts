/**
 * The per-brain rotation: connection sweep, schedule pass, retention.
 *
 * One job, three passes, because they want the same thing — every brain's turn,
 * reasonably often, a few brains per tick — and splitting them into three jobs
 * would mean three cursors over the same table, three rotations drifting out of
 * step, and three chances to page through every space in the system.
 *
 * ## Why none of these is a workflow schedule
 *
 * Four of Resparkable's background workflows are calendar events — "9am on the 2nd",
 * "Friday at 16:00" — and a cron row expresses those exactly. The connection
 * sweep is not one: it is a continuous pass over stored vectors with its own
 * rotation cursor, which should run *often and cheaply* rather than *at a
 * particular moment*. That is the shape ask #1 argued for upstream and got, as
 * `registerAppJob({ name, intervalMs, run })` (#469).
 *
 * It is also free. `sweepConnections` reads vectors that are already stored and
 * finds neighbour pairs in SQL (D4), so there is no embedding cost per run —
 * which is what makes leaving it on for ever affordable.
 *
 * Retention (phase 8) is the same shape and joined the rotation for the same
 * reason, against a plan that had put it in the nightly workflow. Nothing about
 * it is a moment: no user cares whether a 400-day-old event is deleted at 02:00
 * or 14:00, only that it eventually is. Per-user cron rows would have bought
 * that nothing, and cost a row each to create, correct after a DST change and
 * delete on erasure — the exact three problems phase 7 spent its schedule code
 * on. `install.md` §2.10 said "the retention pass joins it in phase 8"; this is
 * that, and `plan.md` §11 has been corrected to match.
 *
 * ## The second cursor
 *
 * `registerAppJob` fires **one process-wide callback** while `sweepConnections`
 * takes an `OwnerScope`, so this job has to choose whose brain to sweep. Both
 * obvious answers are wrong: sweeping everyone is unbounded work inside a
 * 60-second tick, and sweeping "the first N" re-sweeps the same N for ever.
 *
 * The second is worth naming, because this codebase has already met it: the
 * sweep's own per-type cursor exists because ordering candidates
 * most-recently-embedded-first re-examined the same 200 rows every run and left
 * a 900-project corpus 78% unreachable, while the log said only that it had
 * stopped early. Without a cursor across *users*, that bug reappears one level
 * up and just as quietly.
 *
 * So: page through spaces oldest-swept-first, a small batch per tick, stamping
 * as we go (`ResparkableSpace.lastSweptAt`).
 *
 * ## Multi-instance
 *
 * `registerAppJob` keeps last-run times **in process memory**, so N instances
 * run this N times per interval and a restart re-arms it. That is harmless here
 * — the cursor is in the database, so two instances racing take different
 * batches or redo work that is idempotent by construction (pair exclusion,
 * including the `rejected` tombstone, happens inside the query). **Any future
 * job registered here must clear the same bar**, and the seam gives no warning
 * if it does not.
 *
 * Retention clears it the same way, and it is the pass where clearing it
 * matters most, because it is the only one that removes rows. Every rule filters
 * on `archivedAt: null` or on rows that no longer exist after the first pass, so
 * a duplicate run archives nothing twice and deletes nothing twice — it finds an
 * empty batch and returns zero.

/**
 * One tick's worth of sweeping.

 *
 * **A failing brain does not stop the batch.** One user's sweep throwing — a
 * dimension mismatch after a model swap, say — must not stop the other three
 * from being swept, and must not stop the cursor moving past it. Otherwise a
 * single bad corpus wedges the rotation for everybody, which is the same
 * class of silent stall the cursor exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why the schedule pass rides along here
 *
 * `ensureResparkableSchedules` is idempotent and self-correcting, but until it runs
 * it corrects nothing — and `ensureResparkableSpace` only calls it on the branch
 * that *creates* a space, so an existing brain would never see it again. That
 * left the DST rewrite unreachable in practice, and would have left a schedule
 * carrying a stale `inputTemplate` failing its workflow for ever.
 *
 * Putting it on the rotation is what makes "self-correcting" true: every brain
 * gets the pass once per rotation, including the dormant ones, and it costs two
 * indexed queries against a batch of four. The read path stays untouched —
 * `ensureResparkableSpace` is called at the top of capture, chat and every resource
 * service, and adding two queries to all of them to catch a twice-a-year offset
 * change would be the wrong trade.
 *
 * It is failure-isolated from the connection sweep in both directions: neither
 * half of a brain's turn can cost it the other.
