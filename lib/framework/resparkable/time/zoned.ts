 * different depending on where the person is. The plan is blunt about the cost
 * of getting it wrong: a task that unsnoozes at 2am because the server runs UTC
 * "is the kind of small wrongness that makes a tool feel careless" (§10). So
 * `ResparkableSpace.timezone` is the reference frame for all of it, and server time
 * is never consulted for anything but "now".
 *
 * **No new dependency.** `date-fns` is in the tree but its time-zone package is
 * not, and the whole job here is one primitive — convert between an instant and
 * a zone's wall clock — which `Intl.DateTimeFormat` already does. Everything
 * below is built from that one conversion.
 *
 * Instants stored in the database are always UTC `DateTime` columns. These
 * helpers only decide *which* instant a wall-clock phrase refers to.
