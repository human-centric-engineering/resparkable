/**
 * The impure half of prioritisation: gather the scorer's inputs, run the pure
 * function, write the results.
 *
 * `score.ts` holds every decision; this file holds every query. The split is
 * what keeps the ~40-case table test free of mocks, and it is why the rules can
 * be reviewed without reading a single Prisma call.
 *
 * **Everything is loaded in batch.** A pass over a user's tasks issues a fixed
 * number of queries: tasks, their projects, those projects' linked goals,
 * today's remaining blocks, regardless of how many tasks there are. CLAUDE.md
 * bans N+1 on list pages; the same reasoning applies with more force to a loop
 * that runs nightly over every row a user owns.
 *
 * Triggered from three places (§10):
 *   - the nightly workflow, over everything (phase 7)
 *   - a task mutation, over the single row (`rescoreTask`)
 *   - `resparkable_reprioritise`, the capability that lets the agent ask for a pass
 *     without ever supplying a number (phase 6)
