/**
 * The priority scorer — pure, and deliberately the most boring code in Resparkable.
 *
 * **Prioritisation is deterministic code, not an LLM (D3).** The score is
 * computed here, persisted to `ResparkableTask.priorityScore`, and every list
 * endpoint is then one indexed `ORDER BY` with zero per-request compute. An LLM
 * chooses among the top ~10 and writes rationales; it never produces a number
 * that lands in the column.
 *
 * Two properties this file exists to guarantee:
 *
 *   1. **It does no I/O.** Every input arrives as an argument, including `now`.
 *      That is what makes the ~40-case table test (§16.1b) a table test rather
 *      than a mocking exercise, and it is why the same function can run in a
 *      batch pass over 5000 tasks without touching the database once.
 *   2. **Nothing here depends on when a background job last ran.** An expired
 *      `manualBoost` reads as `0` at *evaluation* time; it is never lazily
 *      zeroed by the nightly pass. So a pin set in March and forgotten stops
 *      applying the moment it expires, whether or not anything has run since —
 *      the alternative is a ranking that silently stopped following its own
 *      maths and nobody can tell.
 *
 * The formula (plan §10):
 *
 *   base  = 0.35·urgency + 0.30·goalAlignment + 0.18·projectMomentum
 *         + 0.12·effortFit + 0.05·staleness                         ∈ [0,1]
 *
 *   score = clamp(base + activeManualBoost, -1, 2)
 *
 * `manualBoost` is applied **additively after** the weighted sum, never as a
 * seventh weighted term. A weighted term gets diluted by its own weight and can
 * guarantee nothing; additive-after means `+1` provably outranks every unboosted
 * task and `-1` provably sinks below them. That guarantee is the entire point of
 * the feature, and it only holds while `base` stays within `[0, 1]` — which is
 * why `resolvePriorityWeights()` normalises.
 *
 * `snoozeCount` is **not** an input, at any value. Repeated snoozing is a signal
 * the monthly review reads directly (§10); feeding it into the ranking would
 * make the ranking inexplicable.
