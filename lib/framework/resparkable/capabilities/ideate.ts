/**
 * `resparkable_ideate` — the deliberate counterpart to the passive sweep.
 *
 * The nightly job *notices* connections; this is the user asking for them. It
 * pulls the seed's loosest neighbours — a wider floor than the sweep uses,
 * because the interesting framings come from the pairs that are nearly
 * unrelated — and asks a model for N distinct angles.
 *
 * **Read-only, and still not idempotent.** It writes no row of the user's, but
 * it bills an LLM call and returns different framings each time. Marking it
 * idempotent would tell the engine to skip its dispatch cache, which is exactly
 * the wrong instinct for the one capability here that costs money per call.
