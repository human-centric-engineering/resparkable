/**
 * `resparkable_get_snapshot` — the whole brain, in one call, shaped for a model.
 *
 * The alternative is an agent that opens a conversation with six tool calls to
 * assemble the same picture, spends six round trips doing it, and gets a
 * different picture each time depending on which it remembered. `buildSnapshot`
 * assembles it in eight queries flat and is the same function `GET
 * /resparkable/snapshot` serves, so the chat surface, the MCP client and the phase-7
 * workflows all see one shape.
 *
 * It is a **read with a side effect that isn't one**: `buildSnapshot` bootstraps
 * the space row if it is missing, because an agent's first act on a brand-new
 * brain can perfectly well be a read and every other table has an FK to it.
