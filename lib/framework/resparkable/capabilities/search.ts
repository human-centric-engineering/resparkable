/**
 * `resparkable_search` — the tool that makes the agent worth talking to.
 *
 * One capability covers documents, people and notes alike because
 * `searchResparkable` takes `entityTypes` (plan §5): a separate
 * `resparkable_search_documents` would be a second tool the model has to choose
 * between, and choosing badly means silently missing half the corpus.
 *
 * The returned data carries `sources`, which the engine lifts onto the workflow
 * trace. That is what turns "the agent suggested this" into "the agent suggested
 * this because of these four notes" in the approval and trace UI — and it is the
 * only reason the weekly review is trustable without re-deriving it by hand.
