/**
 * `resparkable_capture` — the agent's door into the inbox.
 *
 * The same door the phone, the share sheet and inbound email use: it calls
 * `captureThought`, which is what `POST /resparkable/capture` calls. That is the
 * whole reason phase 6a built the service before this phase built the tool —
 * two implementations of "capture a thought" would have drifted on defaults, on
 * the `captured` event, and on what a replay does.
 *
 * `source` is pinned to `'agent'` here rather than accepted as an argument. It
 * is the field the triage prompt and the briefing both read to decide how much
 * of the wording is the user's own, so a model that could set it to `'voice'`
 * would be able to launder its own paraphrase as something the user said.
