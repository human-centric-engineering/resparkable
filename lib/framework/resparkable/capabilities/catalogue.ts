/**
 * The twenty-two capability rows, as data.
 *
 * **One source of truth for a capability's identity, and it is not the class.**
 * A capability exists in three places at once — a TypeScript handler, an
 * `AiCapability` row, and the JSON function definition the model actually sees —
 * and only the third is what the LLM is steered by. When the seed's copy of the
 * function definition drifts from the class's, nothing fails: the tool keeps
 * working and the model keeps being told about a parameter that no longer
 * exists. So the descriptions live here, the classes read their own entry, and
 * the seed writes rows straight from this array.
 *
 * This module is **pure data with no imports beyond the vocabularies**. That is
 * deliberate: `prisma/seeds/framework-resparkable/001-capabilities.ts` imports it,
 * and a seed that had to load the service layer to write a row would be a seed
 * that fails on a half-migrated database.
 *
 * The parameter schemas below mirror the `agent*Schema` Zod schemas in
 * `lib/framework/resparkable/validations.ts` — the JSON tells the model what to
 * send, the Zod decides what is accepted, and `catalogue.test.ts` asserts the
 * two agree on which keys exist. Where they differ deliberately (a `default` the
 * model needn't repeat) the Zod is the one that wins.
