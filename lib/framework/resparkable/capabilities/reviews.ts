/**
 * `resparkable_write_review` — where a generated artefact lands.
 *
 * The one capability whose content the model *authored* rather than read. That
 * changes nothing about redaction — a weekly review is a summary of the user's
 * own work and is no less theirs for having been drafted by a model — but it
 * does change the failure mode worth guarding: this always **creates**, never
 * updates. A re-run after a failed workflow leaves the earlier version intact
 * and produces a second row, which is the right way round. Losing a review
 * because a retry overwrote it with a worse one is not recoverable; two reviews
 * on the same day is a list with two entries.
