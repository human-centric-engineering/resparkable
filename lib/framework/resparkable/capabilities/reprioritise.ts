/**
 * `resparkable_reprioritise` — the tool that proves the LLM does not do the ranking.
 *
 * Decision D3: `priorityScore` is **written, not computed per request**, by a
 * pure function over six weighted factors. This capability runs that function.
 * It takes no arguments at all — not a weight, not a filter, not a list of ids —
 * because every one of those would be a way for a model to influence an ordering
 * the user is entitled to treat as mechanical. An LLM chooses among the top few
 * and explains why; it never produces a number that lands in the column.
 *
 * The result is a count, deliberately. Returning the newly ranked tasks would
 * invite the model to summarise a ranking it did not compute, and the tool for
 * reading the list is `resparkable_list_tasks`.
