/**
 * The shared parent of every Resparkable capability.
 *
 * Its whole job is to make the two things that must never be forgotten
 * impossible to forget:
 *
 *   1. **A capability without a user does nothing.** `CapabilityContext.userId`
 *      is `string | null` — null for a system-initiated run with no owner — and
 *      a tool that shrugged and read "everything" would be the largest leak in
 *      the product. Subclasses implement {@link ResparkableCapability.run}, which
 *      receives an already-minted `OwnerScope` and has no way to ask for another
 *      one. There is no code path from a subclass to an unscoped read.
 *   2. **The user id is never an argument.** It arrives from the session
 *      (`withAuth`), from the MCP key's owner, or from the schedule row's `scope`
 *      column on a background run — the three places the platform sets it — and
 *      never from the model. No `agent*Schema` in `validations.ts` has a `userId`
 *      or a `scope` field, and `.strict()` makes an attempt to add one a
 *      validation error rather than a silent drop. (The schedule route read
 *      `execution.userId` until Resparkable 0.8.0 made scheduled runs system-owned;
 *      see {@link requireResparkableUser}.)
 *
 * **What this file cannot do for you: `redactProvenance`.** Every Resparkable
 * capability sets `processesPii = true` (a brain is nothing *but* PII), and the
 * dispatcher's check is `Object.getPrototypeOf(instance).hasOwnProperty(...)` —
 * an own-property test on the *immediate* prototype. An override inherited from
 * this class would not satisfy it, and the registration would throw at boot.
 * That is the right outcome: each capability persists different things onto the
 * durable audit row, and "what of this is safe to keep for ever" is a decision
 * per tool, not per tier. The helpers below make writing one a line or two.

 * The one place a capability's `OwnerScope` comes from.
 *
 * The owner arrives by one of two platform-set routes, never from an LLM
 * argument — which is what makes this the trust boundary rather than a
 * convenience:
 *
 *   1. **`context.userId`** — `streamChat` sets it from the session, the MCP
 *      protocol handler from the API key's owner.
 *   2. **`context.scope[RESPARKABLE_SCHEDULE_OWNER_KEY]`** — a scheduled run. Since
 *      Resparkable 0.8.0 (resparkable#502) the scheduler writes `userId: null` on every
 *      execution, so a background run reaches here system-owned and route 1 is
 *      empty. The owner travels on the schedule row's `scope` column instead;
 *      see {@link RESPARKABLE_SCHEDULE_OWNER_KEY} for why that column and what it
 *      costs.
 *
 * **Order matters, and this is the safe direction.** `context.userId` wins when
 * both are present. A session-authenticated turn is the stronger claim, so a
 * stale or mismatched scope on some future row cannot redirect a live user's
 * capability at another brain — the fallback only ever fills a gap.
 *
 * Exported so a capability that needs the scope before validating (none do
 * today) can reach it directly; the base class calls it for everything else.
