/**
 * `resparkable_notify` — tell the owner something is ready, and nothing more.
 *
 * ## This is the only capability that can reach outside the app, so it is the
 * most constrained one
 *
 * Every other Resparkable capability reads or writes rows that stay behind a
 * session. This one sends an email, which is durable, unrevocable, copied
 * through mail servers, and readable by anyone who later gets into the inbox. A
 * naive version takes `{ to, subject, body }` and is three separate problems:
 *
 *   1. **An exfiltration channel.** A model that can put arbitrary text in an
 *      email can move a brain out of the system a paragraph at a time, and
 *      prompt injection through a synced note or an inbound capture is a real
 *      path to making it do so.
 *   2. **Impersonation.** Attacker-chosen wording arriving from the product's
 *      own address is a phishing primitive with the user's trust attached.
 *   3. **Content sprawl.** Even used honestly, mailing the briefing copies goals
 *      and task titles somewhere the tier's erasure guarantees do not reach.
 *
 * So: **no recipient argument, no subject argument, no body argument.** The
 * model picks one of a closed set of notifications and, at most, supplies a
 * bare integer. Everything a recipient reads is rendered here. The model
 * decides *whether* to notify; it can never decide what the notification says.
 *
 * ## The address is resolved now, not stored
 *
 * `findOwnerContact` reads the `user` row at send time. A `null` means the
 * account is gone — which happens when an orphaned `AiWorkflowSchedule` fires
 * after erasure — and the correct response is to skip quietly rather than fail a
 * workflow over a notification nobody will receive.

 * worst a compromised model can do is claim the wrong number of connections
 * were found.
 *
 * Plain text rather than Markdown, because `WorkflowNotification` renders its
 * body into a single `<Text>` — newlines survive, `##` does not.
 *
 * **Exported so it can be tested directly.** Everything a recipient reads is
 * decided here, so this is the function whose output matters; reaching it
 * through a React element handed to a mocked mailer would test the assertion
 * against React's internals rather than against the wording.
