/**
 * The shared body of the four `resparkable_upsert_*` capabilities.
 *
 * **Upsert is a tool-shaped verb, not an HTTP one.** A route has `POST` and
 * `PATCH` and a caller who knows which it wants; a model has one call and an id
 * it either has or hasn't, and giving it two tools to choose between doubles the
 * ways it picks wrong. Folding both into one call means the only decision left
 * is "do I have an id", which is a decision it can actually get right.
 *
 * Everything below routes through `ResparkableResource`, the same descriptor the
 * HTTP handlers use (plan §3). That is what keeps an agent-created project
 * identical to a UI-created one: same slug resolution, same activity events,
 * same `lastActivityAt` bump feeding `projectMomentum`. A second write path
 * would diverge on all three and the divergence would surface months later as
 * "the agent created it wrong".
 *
 * The create branch re-parses through the resource's own `createSchema`, which
 * is what applies the defaults (`status: 'todo'`, `status: 'active'`) that the
 * partial upsert schema deliberately drops. The parse cannot fail on a missing
 * required field: the `agentUpsert*Schema` already refused that case with a
 * message written for a model to act on.
