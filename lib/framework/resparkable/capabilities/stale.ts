/**
 * `resparkable_get_stale_digest` — the four dormancy questions, for the workflow
 * that asks them.
 *
 * Read-only, like every capability that ends in `get_`. It cannot archive,
 * cannot drop and cannot mark anything still live: §11 puts the decision with a
 * human, and a tool that could act on its own findings would make the digest a
 * rule again by the back door. The monthly horizon check calls this, writes
 * prose about it, and the prose links to a screen where a person clicks.
 *
 * That restraint is enforced by binding rather than by prompt, as everywhere
 * else in the tier: `resparkable_still_live` does not exist as a capability at all,
 * so there is nothing for an agent to be tempted by.
