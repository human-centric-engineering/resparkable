/**
 * `resparkable_promote_thought` — the act the inbox exists for.
 *
 * **Why this is the fourteenth capability and not one of the plan's thirteen.**
 * §5 of `plan.md` lists thirteen, and none of them can mark a thought as
 * processed. Building exactly that list gave a nightly triage agent that creates
 * tasks and asserts links and then leaves every thought sitting in the inbox
 * looking un-triaged — so the next night it processes them again, and the person
 * wakes up to the same twenty notes with a growing pile of duplicate tasks
 * beside them. The gap is in the plan rather than in the implementation of it,
 * and it is cheaper to close now than to discover from a workflow in phase 7.
 *
 * It wraps `promoteThought`, the service `POST /resparkable/thoughts/[id]/promote`
 * already calls, which is what makes it worth a capability rather than two calls
 * the agent could make itself: a create-then-update from the model would miss
 * `promotedToType` / `promotedToId` (absent from the update schema by design),
 * the `ResparkableLink` back to the new item, and the `promoted` event the weekly
 * review counts.
 *
 * **Dropping a thought is deliberately not here.** Promotion is additive and
 * visible; marking someone's note as rubbish is neither, and a nightly job that
 * does it unattended is a job they turn off. The triage prompt says to leave what
 * it cannot classify, and the absent capability is what makes that true.
