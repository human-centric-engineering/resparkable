/**
 * Resparkable's background workflows, as definitions.
 *
 * ## What runs where, and why
 *
 * Four workflows, each fired by its own kind of row on the job queue
 * (`queue/kinds.ts`), plus `resparkable-capture-intake` which is fired by the
 * Postmark inbound trigger instead.
 *
 * They were on per-user `AiWorkflowSchedule` cron rows until phase 56, and the
 * argument for that was sound as far as it went: these four are calendar
 * events — "9am on the 2nd", "Friday at 16:00" — and a cron expression says
 * that exactly. What it says badly is *whose* 9am, because the schedule row has
 * no timezone column, so the offset had to be folded into the expression and
 * corrected twice a year. The queue stores the next moment instead. **Nothing
 * in this file changed**: the workflows, their agents and their steps are
 * identical, and a job queues the same `PENDING` execution the scheduler used
 * to write.
 *
 * ## Every step is a tool call or an agent call
 *
 * There is no `route` step and no `report` step anywhere here, and both absences
 * are deliberate corrections to `plan.md` §6 rather than simplifications:
 *
 * - **`report`** renders the workflow's *own execution trace*, not domain facts.
 *   Pointed at a briefing it produces a description of the briefing's machinery.
 *   The factual half is rendered by `services/briefing-facts.ts` instead.
 * - **`route`** is an LLM classifier. Branching on `workStyle` through it would
 *   spend a model call reading a `VarChar(16)` already in the row, and could
 *   return the wrong branch. `resparkable_get_briefing_inputs` reads the column
 *   server-side and returns a `promptKey`.
 *
 * ## The owner travels on the execution, never in a step
 *
 * No step here names a user. `processDueSchedules` stamps
 * `execution.userId = schedule.createdBy`, the engine threads it into
 * `CapabilityContext.userId`, and `ResparkableCapability` mints the `OwnerScope`
 * from that. A `userId` in a step config would be a second, weaker path to the
 * same thing — and the one an LLM could influence.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * `maxCostPerExecutionUsd` is set on every workflow. `plan.md` §6 is right that
 * the orchestrator step's `budgetLimitUsd` caps only that step; a runaway
 * nightly run is the failure nobody notices until the invoice.
