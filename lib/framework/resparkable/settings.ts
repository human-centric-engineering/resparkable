/**
 * Space settings — defaults, and the safe read of three `Json` columns.
 *
 * `priorityWeights`, `energyProfile` and `retentionPolicy` are `Json?` in
 * Postgres, which means the database guarantees nothing about their shape. A
 * row can hold `{"urgency": "loads"}` after a bad migration, a hand-edit, or a
 * restore from an older backup — and the scorer would then multiply by a string
 * and write `NaN` into every `priorityScore` in the account.
 *
 * So **every read of these columns goes through a resolver here**, never
 * `space.priorityWeights as PriorityWeights`. The resolvers safe-parse and fall
 * back to the defaults rather than throwing: a malformed settings blob should
 * degrade to standard behaviour with a warning, not take a user's whole brain
 * offline. That is the opposite of the rule at the HTTP boundary, where a
 * malformed body is a 400 — the difference is that here there is no caller to
 * correct, and the data is already stored.
 *
 * Defaults live in code, not in the row (`services/space.ts` creates spaces with
 * these columns null). Adding a factor or a retention window then costs nothing;
 * defaults written into every row at creation would need a backfill.

 * **`discard` is the default, and that is a security decision rather than a

 * Discarding the bytes after parsing keeps the extracted text and the embedding
 * chunks, which is what the product actually uses, and leaves no blob to leak.
 *
 * `retain` is available for deployments whose provider declares
 * `capabilities.privateObjects` and `capabilities.signedUrls`. The admin page
 * names the resolved provider and says what it can do, so the choice is
 * informed.
 *
 * This was ask #15, filed when the interface had no read method at all and
 * `LocalProvider` silently ignored `public: false`. Resparkable closed it
 * (resparkable#490): the local provider gained a private root and a signed read
 * route, and capability became a declaration rather than something a caller
 * infers from a provider's name. The default stays `discard` — a capable
 * provider makes retention *possible*, not *advisable*, and keeping bytes you do
 * not need is still the thing that turns a bug into a breach.
