/**
 * Retention queries — the only place in Resparkable that removes things on a timer.
 *
 * Everything here implements one row of the §11 retention table, and the shape
 * of that table is the whole design:
 *
 *   **Nothing a human wrote is ever auto-pruned.** Thoughts, tasks, projects,
 *   goals and reviews auto-*archive* and stop there, permanently, until someone
 *   says otherwise. Only derived and log data — suggested links, events, past
 *   plan blocks, board cards pointing at archived tasks — is deleted.
 *
 * Get that backwards and the product's core promise ("put everything here, it's
 * safe") is false, which is why the two operations have different names,
 * different helpers and different return fields rather than a `mode` flag.
 *
 * ## Three properties that are invisible when they break
 *
 * 1. **A `rejected` link is never pruned.** The connection sweep excludes any
 *    pair that already has a link row, so a `rejected` row *is* the tombstone
 *    that stops the same suggestion returning every Sunday for the rest of the
 *    user's life. Only `status: 'suggested'` is pruned here, and
 *    `retention.test.ts` asserts a rejected row survives a pass dated a century
 *    out. It looks exactly like dead data. It is not.
 *
 * 2. **Archiving drops the entity's vectors in the same transaction.** An
 *    archived row left in the index behind a `WHERE archivedAt IS NULL` filter
 *    makes recall degrade silently as history grows (§17 risk 5b) — no error, no
 *    symptom. The per-id path already does this via `archiveAndDropVectors`;
 *    bulk archiving has to do it too, and `archiveAged()` is the one helper that
 *    both the vector-bearing and vector-free rules go through so the question
 *    "did this type need it?" is answered once, in a table, rather than per rule.
 *
 * 3. **Every rule is capped, and says so.** A first pass over a corpus that
 *    predates retention could touch fifty thousand rows inside a tick with a
 *    60-second budget. Each rule takes `RETENTION_BATCH` at most and reports
 *    `capped`, because — exactly as with the connection sweep's per-type cap —
 *    a run that stopped at its limit is otherwise indistinguishable from a run
 *    that found everything. Retention runs every rotation, so a backlog drains
 *    over a few days rather than in one long tick.
