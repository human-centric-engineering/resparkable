/**
 * Space repo — the one table keyed by `userId` rather than scoped by it.
 *
 * `ResparkableSpace` is where a scope *comes from*, so its reads take a plain
 * verified `userId` instead of an `OwnerScope`: `ensureResparkableSpace()` runs
 * before there is a space to scope to. That is the single exception to the D5
 * signature rule, and it is why this file is short enough to audit at a glance.
 *
 * Lookup by `inboxToken` is the inbound-email entry point — the one place a
 * user id is *derived* from an attacker-supplied value rather than a session,
 * which is why the token is a 16-byte bearer credential and why the adapter
 * must still verify the sender (§17 risk 8).

/**
 * The next brains due a connection sweep, oldest-swept first.
 *
 * **The one unscoped read in the tier, and it is unscoped by necessity rather
 * than by omission.** `registerAppJob` fires a single process-wide callback, so
 * something has to answer "whose brain next?" — a question no `OwnerScope` can
 * express. It is safe precisely because of how little it returns: a user id and
 * the zone their schedules are built in, and no brain content whatsoever. Each
 * id is then minted into its own scope and every subsequent read goes back
 * through the normal owner-scoped path (D5 is untouched — this chooses a scope,
 * it does not bypass one).
 *
 * `timezone` rides along because the tick is also where `ensureResparkableSchedules`
 * reaches existing brains, and it takes the zone as an argument rather than
 * looking it up — deliberately, to keep `services/space` and `schedules/ensure`
 * out of an import cycle. One extra column on a query already being made is the
 * cheapest way to honour that; the alternative is a second read per brain.
 *
 * **`nulls: 'first'` is not optional, and omitting it inverts the whole
 * rotation.** Postgres sorts nulls as *larger* than any non-null value, so plain
 * `ASC` means `NULLS LAST` — a never-swept brain would sort behind every swept
 * one. The failure is not a slow rotation but a stalled one: every row starts
 * null, the first tick stamps a batch, and from the second tick those stamped
 * rows sort ahead of all the nulls and are returned again for ever, while no
 * brain that has never been swept is ever reached. That is exactly the
 * "re-examine the same N and leave the rest unreachable" bug this cursor exists
 * to prevent, one level up — and the tier's own per-type cursor
 * (`repo/embeddings.ts`) already spells the option out for the same reason.
 *
 * A never-swept brain is the most overdue one there is, so it must sort first.
