/**
 * Shared repo primitives — pagination, sort direction, and the "not found"
 * convention every Resparkable repo follows.
 *
 * **Not-found and not-yours are the same answer.** A repo write targets
 * `{ id, userId }` together, so another user's id simply matches no row and the
 * repo returns `null`, which routes turn into a 404. There is deliberately no
 * path that finds the row first and then compares owners: that shape leaks
 * existence through the difference between 403 and 404, and it invites a
 * check-then-act race. See the plan's isolation suite (§16.2) — "B GETs A's
 * project → **404 not 403**".
