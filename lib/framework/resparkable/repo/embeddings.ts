/**
 * Embedding repo — **the only place in Resparkable where vector SQL exists.**
 *
 * The plan (§4) put `searchResparkable` in `search/hybrid-search.ts`, but the tier's
 * ESLint boundary forbids importing Prisma anywhere except `repo/**`, and that
 * constraint is worth more than the file layout: it means the raw SQL — the one
 * place a `WHERE "spaceId" = …` can be forgotten — can only be written in the
 * layer whose every function takes an `OwnerScope`. So the SQL lives here and
 * `search/*` orchestrates around it.
 *
 * Four rules, all load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **`scope.userId` is the first predicate of every statement, always as a
 *      bound parameter.** Never interpolated, never optional, never derived from
 *      an argument. Isolation test: user B's search must not return A's rows
 *      *even when A's row is the better vector match* (§16.2).
 *   2. **`Unsupported("vector(1536)")` cannot be written through the Prisma
 *      client**, so writes are raw `INSERT … ON CONFLICT`. That is not a
 *      shortcut — there is no typed path.
 *   3. **The vector index only ever holds live data.** Archiving deletes an
 *      item's embedding rows outright (see `embeddingDeleteArgs`), so no query
 *      here filters on `archivedAt`. A filtered HNSW search silently
 *      under-returns as history grows, with no error and no symptom — §17 risk
 *      5b, and the reason the archive path is a transaction rather than two
 *      statements.
 *   4. **Pair exclusion happens in SQL, not JS.** A `rejected` link is a
 *      tombstone; the sweep must not re-propose that pair in either direction,
 *      forever. Doing it in the query means it cannot be forgotten by a caller.

 * HNSW stores a full copy of every vector, so it cost roughly as much as the
 * table it indexed and charged a graph traversal on every insert, in exchange
 * for nothing any query could use. The second half stands, and the route back
 * is unchanged: an inner index-usable CTE (`ORDER BY … LIMIT k`) feeding the
 * blend (S4). That changes recall semantics, so it arrives as a decision, and it
 * re-creates the index as part of itself.
 *
 * **Do not describe this as HNSW-accelerated, and do not "restore" the index.**
 * It was documented that way once and it was not true. The same applies to the
 * GIN index over `searchVector` (B7): `ts_rank_cd` here runs over the
 * already-`userId`-filtered candidate set with no `@@` predicate, so that index

// ─── The dimension guard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Fail fast when the active embedding model's dimension doesn't match what is
 * stored.
 *
 * `vector(1536)` is baked into the column DDL, so swapping the active model to
 * one with a different output dimension breaks **every** brain query with a
 * cryptic SQL cast error, after spending an embedding round trip (§17 risk 5).
 * Delegates to the platform's `assertStoredVectorDimensions()`, which Resparkable
 * exported as a table-agnostic guard in response to ask #16 (resparkable#491). Until
 * that landed this file carried a ~40-line port of a private function hard-wired
 * to `aiKnowledgeChunk` — a copy that could only drift, since an upstream fix to
 * the original would never have reached it.
 *
 * What the fork still owns is the **subject**, and specifically that both
 * closures are scoped to the caller. The platform aggregates its whole table,
 * which is right for a single global knowledge base and wrong here: this runs on
 * the hot path of every search, so an unscoped aggregate would make one user's
 * search latency grow with the entire install's corpus, and one user's mismatched
 * vectors would throw for everybody — including a remedy ("re-index the brain")
 * that the person seeing the error cannot perform. Scoping fixes all three, and
 * the closure shape is what makes it expressible without forking the guard.
 *
 * `groupBy` rather than a sampled row so a **partially** re-embedded corpus is
 * caught too — a `findFirst` that happens to land on a matching row would let
 * the mismatch through, and the failure would then look random.
 *
 * Skips silently when there is no active model (legacy resolver default), no
 * corpus, or no recorded dimensions — in all three cases the stored vectors are
 * 1536 by construction. Rows with no recorded dimension are excluded from the
 * grouping for that last reason; counting them as a mismatch is a false alarm.
 *
 * The `logger.error` is the fork's own, and stays: the guard throws a message
 * carrying the same facts, but a thrown string is not queryable. This fires on
 * the search hot path, so the operator wants to see *how many* users hit it and
 * *which* model produced the stale vectors without reading exception text. The
 * catch/rethrow is the price of keeping that while sharing the guard.
