/**
 * Subject-access export (GDPR Art. 15) for the brain.
 *
 * The counterpart to the erasure half. Resparkable already had
 * Art. 17 covered — every `framework_resparkable_*` table cascades from
 * `ResparkableSpace`, whose FK to `"user"` is `ON DELETE CASCADE` — but until
 * Resparkable 0.8.0 there was no seam through which a fork could answer Art. 15 at
 * all. resparkable#467 added one (`lib/app/data-export.ts`), and this is what fills
 * it.
 *
 * **This tier is the case the seam was written for.** A brain is not an app with
 * some personal data in it; it is nothing *but* personal data — captured
 * thoughts, notes on named people, uploaded documents and their extracted text,
 * a record of what its owner worked on and when. An export that omitted it would
 * be a bundle that looks complete and answers almost nothing.
 *
 * ## Two dispositions, matching core's
 *
 * Core's manifest (`lib/privacy/export-sources.ts`) splits sources into
 * `export` and `attribution`; Resparkable has no attribution case, because nothing
 * here is org config a user merely authored — every row *is* theirs. So the
 * split here is **exported** vs **excluded-with-a-reason**, and the reasons are
 * surfaced to the reader rather than left implicit.
 *
 * ## Omission is a deliberate list, not a select
 *
 * Every fetch uses Prisma's `omit` rather than `select`, deliberately copying
 * core's rule: a column added to one of these tables tomorrow is exported by
 * default, and only an explicit `omit` keeps it out. An allowlist `select` would
 * silently narrow the export every time the schema grew — the same quiet-omission
 * failure the coverage guard exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The guard that keeps it complete
 *
 * `tests/unit/lib/framework/resparkable/privacy/subject-export.test.ts` reads
 * `prisma/schema/framework-resparkable.prisma` and fails if a model carrying a
 * `userId` is in neither {@link RESPARKABLE_SUBJECT_SOURCES} nor
 * {@link RESPARKABLE_EXCLUDED_MODELS}. Core cannot write that guard for a fork —
 * `lib/app/data-export.ts` says so explicitly and recommends exactly this
 * pattern. Adding a table without extending this file fails the build rather
 * than shipping a short answer to a data subject.
 *
 * @see lib/app/data-export.ts — the seam this fills
 * @see .context/framework/resparkable/phase-56-plan.md §8 — the Art. 17 half is
 *      the `ResparkableSpace` cascade (D1); the tier has no erasure hook.
 * @see .context/privacy/data-export.md — core's guide
