/**
 * Dormancy queries — what the stale digest asks, and the one thing it writes.
 *
 * These are the read half of §11's "obsolescence is a question, not a rule".
 * Nothing here archives, drops or changes a status: every row these queries
 * return is a **proposal** that a human answers. That is the whole distinction
 * from `repo/retention.ts`, which acts on a clock, and it is why the two live in
 * separate files despite both being about age.
 *
 * **Age is a poor proxy for irrelevance**, which is why each of the three
 * questions below is asked differently:
 *
 *   - A **project** is dormant if nothing has moved *and* nothing has been
 *     finished. `lastActivityAt` alone would flag a project whose tasks are all
 *     being completed by someone who never opens the project row itself.
 *   - A **goal** is dormant if its target date has passed with no evidence
 *     behind it. Age since creation says nothing: a life goal is meant to be old.
 *   - An **entity** is dormant if nothing links to it and nothing has touched
 *     it. Entities are the one type §11 says must **never** be auto-archived —
 *     a dormant client is not a dead one — so this query exists precisely
 *     *because* retention refuses to act on them.
