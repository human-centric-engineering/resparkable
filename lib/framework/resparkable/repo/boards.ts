/**
 * Board repo — named kanban views, and explicit card membership.
 *
 * ## A board is a view, not a container
 *
 * `ResparkableTask.status` is already `todo | next | doing | waiting | done | dropped`
 * — those are the columns, and dragging between them is a `PATCH` of one field
 * (§12). A board therefore stores *which tasks it shows* and *how they are grouped*,
 * never the tasks themselves.
 *
 * ## Two membership modes, and they never mix
 *
 * - **`filter`** (the default): the board is a live query. Its cards are whatever
 *   currently matches, and `ResparkableBoardCard` is not used at all.
 * - **`explicit`**: a hand-curated set — a sprint, a shortlist — where the
 *   membership *is* the content, and so is the order.
 *
 * `position` is honoured **only** for explicit boards. That separation is the point:
 * a filter-backed board is ordered by `priorityScore`, because this app has a
 * scorer and hand-sorting a computed list means maintaining an order that will
 * silently disagree with it. Letting explicit positions leak into filter boards is
 * exactly the failure §12 warns about, so the two orderings live in different code
 * paths rather than in one function with a flag.

 *
 * **One transaction, and the flip and the pinning are both inside it.** A board
 * that had gone `explicit` with no cards written would render empty — a shared
 * board that silently became blank is worse than the leak the snapshot was
 * taken to close. A board still on `filter` with cards written would keep
 * leaking while looking as though it had stopped, which is worse again.
 *
 * The caller resolves which tasks match **and where they sit**, because both are
 * `services/`' job: a second copy of the filter predicate here is exactly what
 * the access layer already warns against, and position arithmetic belongs with
 * `fractional-position.ts` rather than in a file whose job is statements. This
 * writes what it is given, so the snapshot preserves the order the owner was
 * looking at.
