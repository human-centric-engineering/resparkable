/**
 * Reads of the **core** orchestration agent rows Resparkable seeds.
 *
 * This is the one repo module whose functions do **not** take an `OwnerScope`,
 * and the exception needs stating rather than assuming. `AiAgent` is
 * instance-wide configuration — a model choice, a temperature, a set of
 * guardrails an operator edits in the admin UI. It is not user data, it has no
 * `userId`, and there is nothing to scope by. Passing a scope would imply an
 * isolation guarantee that neither exists nor is needed.
 *
 * It lives in `repo/**` anyway because the tier's rule is not "owner-scoped
 * queries go here" — it is **"the database is only reachable from here"**
 * (`lib/framework/eslint.config.mjs`). A service importing `prisma` to read one
 * config row is exactly the bypass that turns D5 from a boundary back into a
 * convention, and the boundary is worth more than the exception is
 * inconvenient.
 *
 * Nothing here assumes the rows exist. Before phase 6b's seeds run they do not,
 * and every caller must handle `null` by falling back rather than failing.
