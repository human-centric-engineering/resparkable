/**
 * Link repo — owner-scoped reads over the polymorphic edge table.

 * Phase 3 needed exactly one thing here — the accepted project → goal edges the
 * scorer's `goalAlignment` walk follows. Phase 4 added the write side: the
 * connection sweep suggests pairs, and a human accepts, rejects or snoozes them.
 *
 * `ResparkableLink` has **no foreign keys to its endpoints** (D2) — it is
 * polymorphic, so `sourceId` and `targetId` are bare strings the database will
 * not validate. Two consequences the callers here have to live with:
 *
 *   1. A link can outlive the row it points at. Every read is a candidate for
 *      dangling ids, so callers resolve them against rows they fetched
 *      themselves rather than trusting the edge.
 *   2. Direction is not meaningful for `relates_to`. A project → goal edge may
 *      have been written either way round, so the query below matches both and
 *      normalises.
