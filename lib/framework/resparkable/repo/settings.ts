 * Everything else in `repo/**` is owner-scoped by construction (D5). This table
 * is not, because what it holds is not user data: "does this deployment's
 * storage provider hold private objects safely?" has one answer per install,
 * owned by whoever operates the install. Erasing a user must not change it, and
 * scoping it to a user would be meaningless.
 *
 * That makes this file the exception a reviewer should look at twice, so it is
 * deliberately tiny and holds nothing else. If a second instance-scoped concern
 * ever appears, it goes here beside this one rather than growing a scope-free
 * accessor somewhere less visible.
 *
 * Writes are admin-only, enforced at the route by `withAdminAuth` — this layer
 * has no idea who is calling, which is exactly why the guard cannot live here.
