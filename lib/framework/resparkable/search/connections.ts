/**
 * The connection engine — embedding-to-embedding, not LLM-over-corpus (D4).
 *
 * This is the part of the plan that makes proactive connection-hunting
 * affordable to run forever: the sweep reads vectors that are **already stored**
 * and finds neighbour pairs in SQL. Zero tokens, zero API calls, no per-run cost
 * that grows with the corpus. An LLM writes rationales later (phase 6), and only
 * for pairs that already cleared the floor — so the expensive step sees tens of
 * candidates rather than the whole brain.
 *
 * ## Why thought-to-thought is the interesting pass
 *
 * Projects and goals are well-formed; their collisions are usually things you
 * already knew. **Two half-formed thoughts captured six weeks apart that turn out
 * to be the same idea** is where article and podcast ideas actually come from
 * (plan §4). It is also the pass that can hurt: pair count is quadratic in the
 * number of thoughts, so it is bounded to a recent window and a candidate cap,
 * and both bounds are logged rather than applied silently.

/**
 * Minimum cosine similarity for a pair to be worth a human's attention.
 *
 * **0.55, measured — not the plan's 0.72, which surfaced nothing.**
 *
 * The plan specified 0.72 (§4). Against `text-embedding-3-small`, the model the
 * platform resolves by default, that floor sits *above* the signal. Measured on
 * realistic notes:
 *
 * | pair                                                    | similarity |
 * | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
 * | "Draft the talk about how small teams ship faster" ↔     |            |
 * | "Article idea: why tiny teams outrun large ones"        | **0.679**  |
 * | "Chase the invoice" ↔ "VAT return is due"               | 0.402      |
 * | "VAT return is due" ↔ "Set aside for corporation tax"   | 0.362      |
 * | "VAT return is due" ↔ "Try sourdough at the weekend"    | 0.192      |
 *
 * The first row is the exact payoff the plan describes — two fragments of one idea
 * captured weeks apart — and 0.72 misses it. At 0.72 the connection engine is
 * inert: it runs, costs nothing, and proposes nothing, for ever, with no error.
 * That is the failure mode this whole file is written to avoid.
 *
 * 0.55 admits the same-idea pair and still rejects both the loosely-related
 * accounting cluster (0.31–0.40, where "both about money" is not a useful
 * suggestion) and the noise (≤0.19). Deliberately conservative: the plan is right
 * that a connections view full of weak pairs is one nobody opens twice.
 *
 * **This number is model-dependent, which is the real lesson.** The active
 * embedding model is operator-configurable, and a different one compresses its
 * similarity range differently — so a hard-coded floor is only ever right for one
 * model. Making it a per-user setting is a phase-5 follow-up, once the Connections
 * view exists to judge suggestion quality against.
 * `npm run framework:resparkable:smoke-search` prints the best similarity the corpus
 * actually contains alongside this floor, so a mis-set floor is visible rather
 * than silent.
