/**
 * Resparkable's agent and profile slugs.
 *
 * The **rows** are seed data (`prisma/seeds/framework-resparkable/`); these are the
 * identifiers that code needs to refer to them by. Two rules keep the split
 * clean:
 *
 *   - **Slugs live here.** A slug is an identity that a route, a service and a
 *     seed all have to agree on, and a typo in any one of them fails at runtime
 *     rather than at compile time. One constant, imported everywhere, makes that
 *     a build error instead.
 *   - **Prompt text does not.** Personas, guardrails and system instructions are
 *     seed data and belong in the seed files, because an operator can edit them
 *     in the admin UI. A copy in `lib/` would silently disagree with the database
 *     the moment someone did — and the copy in the bundle is the one nobody
 *     thinks to check.
 *
 * Nothing here depends on the rows existing. A slug that has not been seeded yet
 * simply resolves to no agent, and callers fall back (see `services/ideate.ts`,
 * which resolves the system default model when the ideation agent is absent).
