/**
 * What the brain exposes over MCP, as data.
 *
 * Same rule as `capabilities/catalogue.ts`: the rows are written from here, not
 * typed out in the seed. A capability is already spread across a handler, an
 * `AiCapability` row and a JSON function definition; adding a fourth hand-copy
 * of "which tools does Claude Code get" is how a list drifts silently.
 *
 * ## Why the list itself is the access control
 *
 * `McpApiKey.scopedAgentId` looks like it narrows a key to that agent's bound
 * capabilities. It does not. `listMcpTools()` scoping is **default-allow** — it
 * drops only capabilities with an explicit `AiAgentCapability { isEnabled:
 * false }` row for the agent, and Resparkable's bindings work by *absence* (a
 * capability an agent may not use simply has no row). So a key scoped to
 * `resparkable-companion` can still call every enabled `McpExposedTool`, including
 * ones the companion itself is not bound to.
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating plainly, because the intuitive reading is
 * the opposite: **these rows, not the agent bindings, decide what an MCP client
 * can do to someone's brain.** `mcp-exposure.test.ts` asserts nothing that
 * writes structure is on the list, for the same reason
 * `004-agent-capabilities` asserts the judge is bound to nothing.
 *
 * ## Why the writes are (nearly) all absent
 *
 * `resparkable_capture` is here because capture is the product's premise and an
 * editor is where thoughts happen. It only ever adds an inbox item — the thing
 * triage exists to sort out later — so the worst a confused client can do is
 * give you something to process in the morning.
 *
 * Everything that creates *structure* — projects, goals, people, links,
 * promotions, reviews — is deliberately absent. Those are the person's own
 * decisions about the shape of their work, they change what the scorer ranks
 * tomorrow, and an MCP client is the one caller with no UI in which to notice
 * that they happened. An operator who wants them can enable a row in
 * `/admin/orchestration/mcp/tools`; the default should not make that choice for
 * them.
 *
 * `resparkable_get_briefing_inputs` and `resparkable_notify` are absent for a duller
 * reason: they are plumbing for the briefing workflow, and mean nothing to a
 * caller outside it.
 *
 * ## Who the caller is
 *
 * `protocol-handler.ts` sets `CapabilityContext.userId` from `auth.createdBy` —
 * the key's creator. Every Resparkable capability refuses to run without a
 * `userId` (the owner-scope guard), so per-user isolation over MCP is the same
 * guard as everywhere else, with no MCP-specific code. A key whose creator has
 * since been deleted has `createdBy: null` and therefore reaches nothing, which
 * is the right way for that to fail.

/**
 * The two resources.
 *
 * ## Why these are resources and the other reads are tools
 *
 * A client can read a resource without spending a turn: it attaches the
 * content to the conversation itself, where a tool call costs a round trip and
 * a decision by the model to make it. That is the right shape for the two
 * reads a person opens a session *already wanting*, and the wrong shape for
 * anything the model should choose to do.
 *
 * So the split is not "cheap reads become resources". `resparkable_search`
 * takes a query the model composes, `resparkable_ideate` spends money, and
 * `resparkable_find_connections` answers a question nobody asked at the top of
 * a session. Those stay tools. "What does my day look like" and "what is the
 * state of this project" are context, and context belongs in the context
 * window without being asked for.
 *
 * ## The scheme
 *
 * `resparkable://`, which is the platform's own (`CORE_URI_SCHEME`) and is
 * passed explicitly at registration rather than inherited. Core requires a
 * fork to name a scheme so that a fork resource cannot quietly advertise the
 * platform's identity; here the platform and the tier are the same product, so
 * naming it is a statement rather than a leak.
 *
 * ## Both of these are also reachable as tools
 *
 * `resparkable_get_snapshot` overlaps `resparkable://today` and nothing
 * overlaps the project view, so neither row takes a read away from a client
 * that cannot use resources. A key without `resources:read` loses the cheaper
 * door and keeps every answer.
