/**
 * Frontmatter schemas — the boundary where a vault file stops being trusted.
 * **Pure**: Zod and nothing else.
 *
 * A vault is a folder synced from somewhere. Even when it is nominally the
 * user's own, its contents have been through Obsidian, plugins, a zip, possibly
 * a git remote and possibly another person's machine. CLAUDE.md's rule applies
 * with full force: **no `as` on external data — validate first**. Every field the
 * importer reads comes out of one of these schemas.
 *
 * ## Three deliberate choices
 *
 * **Loose objects, not strict ones.** Every schema here is `z.looseObject`, the
 * opposite of the rule the API schemas follow. On an HTTP body a stray key is an
 * attempt to set something, and `.strict()` makes it a 400. In a vault file a
 * stray key is `cssclass`, `aliases`, a Dataview field or whatever plugin the
 * user installed last week — rejecting the file over it would mean Resparkable only
 * accepts notes Resparkable wrote, which is the definition of an export rather than
 * a co-equal surface.
 *
 * **Everything is optional.** A note somebody typed by hand in Obsidian has a
 * title and nothing else, and that has to import. Missing means "not declared",
 * and the importer leaves the corresponding column alone.
 *
 * **`resparkable-id` is validated for shape, never trusted for identity.** It is
 * bounded so it cannot be a megabyte, and that is *all* this file does with it.
 * The rule that a client-supplied id can never address a row — plan §14, and the
 * single most important sync test in §16.7 — is enforced in `import.ts`, which
 * resolves it against an owner-scoped read and mints a new row when it does not
 * match. Putting `cuidSchema` here would look like a check and secure nothing.
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/vault/notes.ts — encode/decode built on these
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/validations.ts — the HTTP-boundary counterpart
