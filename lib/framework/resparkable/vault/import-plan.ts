/**
 * The import planner — **pure**, and that is the most important decision here.
 *
 * `buildImportPlan(notes, index, options)` takes a list of parsed files and a
 * snapshot of what the owner already has, and returns what *would* happen. No
 * DB, no network, no clock. §14 calls this out explicitly: the entire matrix
 * becomes a table-driven unit test with zero mocks, which is what the repo's
 * `testing` skill demands and what makes the behaviour reviewable at all.
 *
 * It is also what makes **dry-run free**. The plan this returns is exactly what
 * the apply step consumes, so "show me what this would do" is not a second code
 * path that can disagree with the first — it is the first code path, stopped one
 * step early. A dry run is the default for a first import for that reason.
 *
 * ## Identity: the one rule that is a security property
 *
 * A file's `resparkable-id` is a **claim**, never an address. It is looked up in an
 * index built from an owner-scoped read, so an id belonging to somebody else is
 * simply absent and the note becomes a new row. That is plan §16.7's single most
 * important sync test — *"a `resparkable-id` in an uploaded vault file belonging to
 * user B is treated as a new item for A, not a hijack of B's row"* — and it is
 * satisfied structurally: this module has no way to express a cross-user read,
 * because it does no reads at all.
 *
 * ## Change detection compares the note we would have written
 *
 * The index holds each existing row **already encoded as a note**, using the same
 * encoders the exporter uses. So "did this change" is a comparison between two
 * notes rather than between a note and a database row, and *export → re-import
 * is a no-op* holds by construction rather than by a matching pair of field
 * lists that could drift.
 *
 * Comparisons are on normalised forms, never raw bytes (§14): YAML key order,
 * quote style, CRLF and a trailing newline otherwise produce most of the
 * "changes" in a file nobody touched.
 *
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/vault/import.ts — the index build and the apply step
