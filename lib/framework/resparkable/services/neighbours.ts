/**
 * "What else is this about?" — one implementation, two callers.
 *
 * `findConnections` returns bare `{ targetType, targetId, strength }` triples,
 * because that is all the vector query knows. Everything that wants to *show*
 * them — the ideation service, the `resparkable_find_connections` capability, and
 * the connections surface after it — needs titles, and needs them fetched one
 * query per type rather than one per row.
 *
 * It lives here rather than inside `services/ideate.ts` (where it started)
 * because the second caller arrived in phase 6b and the two must agree on the
 * part that is easy to get subtly different: **what an empty result means.**
 * `findConnections` returns `[]` for three unrelated reasons — the seed has no
 * stored vector, the seed is indexed but has no neighbour above the floor, or
 * every candidate pair already carries a link row — and only the first is fixed
 * by waiting. A caller that guessed would tell the user "nothing is related"
 * about an item captured ninety seconds ago.
