/**
 * `POST /resparkable/thoughts/[id]/promote` — turn a captured thought into a real thing.
 *
 * ## Why this is a service and not two client calls
 *
 * Triage is the act the inbox exists for: a half-formed note becomes a task, a
 * project or a goal. A client could do that with `POST /resparkable/tasks` followed
 * by `PATCH /resparkable/thoughts/[id]`, and it would look like it worked — but three
 * things would be missing, and all three are invisible when absent:
 *
 *   1. **`promotedToType` / `promotedToId` are not in `updateThoughtSchema`**, so
 *      a PATCH can set `status: 'promoted'` without recording *what it became*.
 *      The thought then says "I turned into something" and cannot say what. Those
 *      columns exist precisely so that question is answerable a year later.
 *   2. **The edge.** A thought that became a task should stay connected to it —
 *      that is what makes the graph a record of how your thinking moved rather
 *      than a snapshot of its current state. One `ResparkableLink`, `origin: 'user'`
 *      because a human made the call, `status: 'accepted'` because it is not a
 *      suggestion.
 *   3. **The event.** `kind: 'promoted'` is what lets the weekly review say "you
 *      turned nine notes into work this week" instead of counting creations and
 *      double-reporting.
 *
 * A single endpoint also means the failure modes are ours rather than the
 * client's: a half-promoted thought (target created, thought untouched) is a
 * confusing state to leave someone in, and every caller — web, agent, MCP — would
 * otherwise have to get the ordering right by itself.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * **No transaction.** The target is created through the existing resource
 * descriptors so it picks up slug resolution, scoring and its own `created`
 * event; those span several statements and a rescore, and wrapping the lot in one
 * interactive transaction to save a rare partial state would hold a connection
 * open across an LLM-free but multi-step path for every triage. The chosen
 * failure mode is the safe one: **the target is created first, and the thought is
 * only marked promoted once that succeeded.** A crash in between leaves a real
 * task and an un-triaged thought — visible, fixable in one click, and nothing
 * lost. The reverse order would lose the note.
