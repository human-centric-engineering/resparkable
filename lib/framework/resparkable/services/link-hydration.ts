/**
 * Turn `ResparkableLink` rows into something a UI can render.
 *
 * ## The problem this solves
 *
 * `ResparkableLink` is polymorphic and has **no foreign keys to its endpoints** (D2),
 * so a row is four opaque strings: `{ sourceType, sourceId, targetType, targetId }`.
 * Every surface that shows connections — the review queue, a project's detail
 * page, an entity's linked items, the graph — needs those turned into titles, and
 * doing it per row is the N+1 `CLAUDE.md` forbids.
 *
 * So: collect every `(type, id)` pair across the whole batch, group by type, and
 * issue **one query per type** via `findSummaries`. Forty links spanning five
 * types is five queries, not eighty.
 *
 * ## Dangling endpoints are a normal state, not an error
 *
 * With no FK there is nothing stopping a link outliving the row it points at, and
 * `services/inbox.ts` already makes this call: an unresolvable endpoint comes back
 * as `null` rather than making the link vanish. Hiding it would silently lose the
 * record that a connection once existed; the UI renders it inertly instead.
 *
 * ## Scoped, like everything else
 *
 * `findSummaries` takes the caller's `SpaceScope`, so an id belonging to someone
 * else hydrates to nothing rather than to their content. That should be impossible
 * — the links were read through a scoped query — but this is the one path where an
 * id crosses back from a polymorphic column into a fresh lookup, and defence in
 * depth is cheap here.
