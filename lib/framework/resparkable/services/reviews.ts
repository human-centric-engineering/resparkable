/**
 * Reviews — how a generated artefact becomes something the UI can render.
 *
 * A review is the durable output of thinking that happened elsewhere: the daily
 * triage summary, the weekly review, the monthly horizon check, the morning
 * briefing. Phase 3 read the latest one so the dashboard could show it. Phase 6
 * adds the write path, because `resparkable_write_review` is one of the thirteen
 * capabilities.
 *
 * **Two things are deliberately not here.**
 *
 * Reviews are not scored, ranked or embedded. `review` is absent from the six
 * embedded types, so a review is findable by browsing and by keyword but not by
 * meaning — the right trade for an artefact that is mostly a restatement of rows
 * that *are* embedded, and one that keeps the vector table from filling with the
 * system's own prose.
 *
 * And a review is never updated. Regenerating writes a new row: "what did the
 * strategist say three weeks ago" is the question the table exists to answer,
 * and an in-place edit destroys it. Archival and deletion exist for the
 * retention pass (§11) to use; nothing rewrites history.
