/**
 * Hand-asserted connections.
 *
 * `ResparkableLink` is polymorphic and has **no foreign keys to its endpoints**
 * (D2), so the database will not check that `sourceId` names a real row — let
 * alone one belonging to the caller. That check is this module's job, and it is
 * the reason this logic is a service rather than a route body.
 *
 * **Why it moved out of the route.** `POST /resparkable/links` carried the endpoint
 * checks, the identical-404 rule and the server-pinned provenance triple inline.
 * `resparkable_link_entities` needs all three, and a capability that reimplemented
 * them would drift: the plan is explicit that agent writes and UI writes must go
 * through the same functions or they diverge in ways that surface months later
 * as "the agent created it wrong" (§3). The route now calls this; so does the
 * capability.
 *
 * The extraction also fixed something the route never did: a hand-made link now
 * records a `linked` event, so the weekly review can see it.
