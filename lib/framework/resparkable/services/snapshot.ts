/**
 * The snapshot — the whole brain, small enough to put in a prompt.
 *
 * `resparkable_get_snapshot` returns this, and phase 6c's context contributor
 * renders the same payload as the `LOCKED CONTEXT` block injected on every chat
 * turn. **One gathering path, two renderings** — because "what the agent already
 * knows" and "what the agent can look up" drifting apart is the kind of bug that
 * shows up as an agent contradicting itself within one conversation.
 *
 * **This is deliberately not `buildToday`.** The dashboard read assembles time
 * blocks, returned-from-snooze flags, unreviewed link rows and full
 * `priorityFactors` blobs, returns Prisma rows with live `Date` objects, and
 * runs eleven queries to do it. An LLM needs none of that and pays for all of
 * it: routing `resparkable_get_snapshot` through `buildToday` would have put several
 * kilobytes of dashboard JSON into a tool result on every call. This is the
 * LLM's shape — flat, short strings, an id on every row so a claim can be traced
 * back to something.
 *
 * **Everything here is bounded by construction.** Each section has a fixed item
 * cap and reports `truncated` when it hit it, because a section that silently
 * stopped at its cap looks exactly like a section that found everything — the
 * same rule the sweep's `cappedTypes` and the graph's `truncated` follow
 * (`ui.md` §7). Query count is fixed at nine regardless of how many rows exist.
