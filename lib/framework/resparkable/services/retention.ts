/**
 * `enforceResparkableRetention()` — one brain's turn through the §11 table.
 *
 * The rules themselves live in `repo/retention.ts`, one function each, because
 * that is the only layer permitted to reach Prisma. This file is the pass: it
 * resolves the user's windows, runs the rules in the one order that matters, and
 * reports what it did in enough detail that a dry run is worth reading.
 *
 * ## Why this is a service and not a workflow step
 *
 * `plan.md` §11 says retention is "run from the nightly workflow"; `install.md`
 * §2.10 says the pass joins the app jobs in phase 8. Those disagreed, and the job
 * is right — for the same reason the connection sweep is a job rather than a
 * fifth schedule. Retention is not a calendar event. It is a continuous
 * cursor-driven pass whose only requirement is that every brain gets a turn
 * reasonably often, and expressing that as a cron row per user buys nothing and
 * costs a row per user that has to be created, corrected after a DST change and
 * deleted on erasure. A brain that is a day late being swept is not a defect;
 * a brain whose 09:00 briefing arrives at 14:00 is.
 *
 * The rules are also written to be safe under the job's weaker guarantee.
 * `registerAppJob` keeps last-run times in process memory, so N instances run
 * this N times per interval — every rule is therefore idempotent (a second pass
 * over an already-archived row matches nothing, because every filter carries
 * `archivedAt: null` or the row is gone) and batched, so a race splits the work
 * rather than doubling it.
 *
 * ## Order
 *
 * Projects run before their tasks would be reached by the completed-task rule,
 * and `pruneCardsForArchivedTasks` runs last so it sees everything the pass
 * archived rather than what the previous pass left. Nothing else here is
 * order-sensitive, and the ones that are, say so.
