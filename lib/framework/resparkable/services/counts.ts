/**
 * `GET /resparkable/counts` — the three numbers the shell needs on every page.
 *
 * ## Why this exists rather than reusing `/today`
 *
 * The Resparkable layout renders on all twelve surfaces and its nav carries "7
 * waiting" badges on Inbox and Connections. `/resparkable/today` already contains
 * those two numbers, so the obvious move is to fetch it from the layout — but
 * `buildToday` runs eleven queries to assemble ranked tasks, time blocks,
 * capacity and the latest review. Paying for all of that on the documents page to
 * render two integers is the same mistake as an N+1, just in the other direction:
 * the query count is fixed, but it is fixed at the wrong number.
 *
 * This is three indexed `COUNT`s. It is what the layout asks for and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why the counts are what they are
 *
 * Each one is a count of things **waiting on a decision**, which is the only kind
 * of number worth putting in a badge. Snoozed thoughts are excluded because a
 * thought you pushed to Monday is explicitly not waiting on you (§10); deferred
 * tasks likewise; and closed statuses are finished business. A badge that counts
 * things you have already dealt with teaches people to ignore badges.
