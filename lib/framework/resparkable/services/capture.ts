/**
 * Capture — the one write path that has to be faster than thinking.
 *
 * `POST /resparkable/capture` and the `resparkable_capture` capability both land here.
 * It is a narrower door than `POST /resparkable/thoughts`: content, where it came
 * from, and an optional idempotency key. Everything else about a thought is a
 * triage decision made later, by a person or by `resparkable-triage`.
 *
 * **Why this doesn't just call `thoughtResource.create`.** It very nearly does —
 * same repo call, same event, same space bootstrap. The difference is the return
 * value: the resource contract returns the row, and capture needs to say
 * *whether the row was new*. A phone that retries on a flaky connection, a
 * Postmark redelivery and a double-tapped Shortcut all have to be answerable
 * with "yes, already got that" rather than a second inbox item — and a caller
 * cannot tell the difference from the row alone, because the deduped row looks
 * exactly like a freshly created one. Widening `ResparkableResource` to carry a
 * per-type extra would have pushed capture's shape into the factory that serves
 * nine other types.
 *
 * **No `enqueueReindex` call.** A new `ResparkableThought` has `indexedHash: null`
 * by construction, which *is* the queued state (`embedding/indexer.ts`). Calling
 * it here would null a column that is already null. The deduped path is the same
 * story from the other side: the existing row's hash is whatever it was, and its
 * content did not change, so it should not be re-examined.
