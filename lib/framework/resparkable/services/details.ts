/**
 * The `/view` builders — one enriched read per detail page.
 *
 * ## Why these exist rather than an `?include=` on the item routes
 *
 * A project page needs the project, its area, its tasks in score order, its
 * connections with both endpoints resolved, and counts. Assembled from the generic
 * `GET /resparkable/projects/[id]` that is one request plus one per task plus one per
 * link — the N+1 `CLAUDE.md` forbids, and on a busy project that is thirty
 * requests assembling a page in front of the user.
 *
 * The generic item handlers stay deliberately bare. Threading per-resource
 * `include` support through `createItemHandlers` would push page-shaped concerns
 * into the one factory that guarantees the isolation rules for twenty routes, and
 * that factory's value is that it has nothing else in it.
 *
 * ## The query count is fixed, and that is the contract
 *
 * Every builder here issues a bounded number of queries regardless of how many
 * tasks or links come back: the entity, its parent, one batched task read, one
 * batched link read, and one `findSummaries` per distinct endpoint type (at most
 * seven). Nothing loops over rows issuing queries. A regression here would not
 * fail a test that only checks the shape, so the route tests assert the count.
 *
 * ## Deliberately absent: tags and checklists
 *
 * `buildTaskView` will grow them when the boards work lands the repo modules they
 * need. Returning empty arrays now would be a lie the UI builds against; leaving
 * the fields out means adding them later is additive.
