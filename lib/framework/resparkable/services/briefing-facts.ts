/**
 * The briefing's factual half, rendered without a model.
 *
 * ## Why this is a service and not a `report` step
 *
 * `plan.md` §6 originally specified the workflow's **`report`** step for this,
 * on the reading that `report` renders deterministic facts. It does not: `report`
 * calls `renderExecutionMarkdown`, which renders the workflow's own execution
 * trace — steps, statuses, tokens, cost, the supervisor's verdict. Pointed at a
 * briefing it emits a description of the briefing's own machinery. So the facts
 * are rendered here, in the tier, and the capability calls this.
 *
 * The economics the plan wanted are unchanged: the numbers cost nothing, and the
 * one LLM call per day writes only the connective prose around them.
 *
 * ## Why the facts are rendered separately from the prose at all
 *
 * Because a model asked to both count and narrate will occasionally do neither
 * accurately, and a briefing that misreports how many tasks are overdue is worse
 * than one that says nothing. Everything falsifiable is produced here; the model
 * is handed the finished numbers and asked only to make them read like English.
 * That is the same division `render-markdown.ts` draws for the trace — structured
 * facts from a renderer, opinion from the model.
 *
 * ## Plain text, not Markdown
 *
 * The renderer emits plain text with real line breaks. The stored review can hold
 * whatever the model writes, but this block also feeds a notification, and
 * `emails/workflow-notification.tsx` renders its body into a single `<Text>`:
 * newlines survive (`whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'`) and `##` arrives as the characters
 * `##`. Emitting Markdown here would look correct everywhere except the one
 * surface nobody re-reads.
