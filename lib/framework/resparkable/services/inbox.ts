/**
 * `GET /resparkable/inbox` — captured thoughts, each with what the system thinks it
 * connects to.
 *
 * The inbox is the front door of the product: things arrive here half-formed
 * from a phone, an email, a voice note, and triage is the act of deciding what
 * each one is. Showing the suggested connections *inline* is what makes that a
 * decision rather than an archaeology exercise — "this looks like it belongs to
 * the Q4 launch project" is the single most useful thing to put next to a
 * two-line note you wrote nine days ago.
 *
 * Suggestions are read from `ResparkableLink`, which the connection sweep populates
 * in phase 4. Until then every thought comes back with an empty list, and that
 * is the correct behaviour rather than a stub: the shape is real, so the UI
 * built against it does not change when the sweep starts writing.
