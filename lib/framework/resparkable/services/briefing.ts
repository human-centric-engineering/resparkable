/**
 * The morning briefing — reading the stored one, and selecting what goes into
 * the next.
 *
 * ## Two functions, two very different costs
 *
 * `getStoredBriefing` is what the button calls. It reads one row and returns it,
 * because `plan.md` §6 is emphatic that nobody should wait twenty seconds after
 * pressing a button for something whose inputs barely changed between 3am and
 * 8am. The nightly workflow writes the briefing; the button serves it.
 *
 * `buildBriefingInputs` is what the *workflow* calls, and it is the piece that
 * replaces a step the plan originally specified. §6 had a **`route`** step
 * branching three ways on `workStyle` — but `route` is an LLM classifier, so
 * that would spend a model call asking a language model to guess a `VarChar(16)`
 * we can simply select, and let it guess wrong. The selection happens here, in
 * code, and the workflow makes exactly one LLM call: the one that writes prose.
 *
 * ## `workStyle` changes the data, not the adjectives
 *
 * This is the rule §6 sets and the reason the whole setting is not theatre: a
 * version that only varied the tone would be the same briefing with different
 * adjectives, and people notice within a week. So each style selects genuinely
 * different rows — and the styles are ordered by *what leads*, not by how much
 * they say.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * §6's exploratory branch also lists "one `resparkable_ideate` angle on an active
 * project". Ideation is an LLM call, and putting one inside the step whose whole
 * purpose is to be free would quietly double the briefing's daily cost. The
 * briefing's own single `llm_call` is already a model looking at the user's
 * material and is perfectly placed to do the framing — so the prompt asks for
 * it, rather than a second model call precomputing it.
