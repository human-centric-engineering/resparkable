/**
 * `GET /resparkable/graph` — a neighbourhood, never the whole corpus.
 *
 * ## Filtered by default, and that is the entire design
 *
 * Obsidian's graph view is the cautionary tale `plan.md` §9 names outright: above a
 * few hundred nodes it becomes a hairball that looks impressive and tells you
 * nothing. So this endpoint **requires a focus node**, defaults to `depth=1`, and
 * caps the node count. A pretty hairball is a demo; a neighbourhood view is a tool.
 *
 * The cap is enforced here rather than in the client because the client cannot
 * enforce it — the cost is the query, and a UI that fetched everything and drew 150
 * of them would have already paid it.
 *
 * ## Truncation is reported, never silent
 *
 * The same principle as the sweep's `cappedTypes`: a graph that stopped expanding
 * because it hit the cap looks exactly like a graph that ran out of connections, and
 * those mean opposite things. `truncated` says which happened.
 *
 * ## Archived items are absent
 *
 * Not filtered for tidiness — their embeddings are deleted on archive (§17 risk 5b),
 * so they are not part of the semantic layer at all. Drawing them would show edges
 * into a region of the graph that no longer participates in anything.
 *
 * ## Rejected links never appear
 *
 * A rejected row is a tombstone that stops the sweep re-proposing a pair (§17 risk
 * 5c). Drawing it would render a dismissal as a connection.
