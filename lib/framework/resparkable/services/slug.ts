/**
 * Slug generation for the three named types (area, project, entity).
 *
 * Slugs are unique **per user**, not globally (`@@unique([userId, slug])`), so
 * two people can both have `acme` and neither learns the other exists.
 *
 * **On the duplicated `slugify`:** Resparkable has one, in
 * `lib/orchestration/knowledge/chunker.ts` — but importing it drags the
 * semantic chunker (and transitively the embedder) into every CRUD route
 * bundle for a five-line string transform. Upstream #451 proposes relocating it
 * to a shared `lib/utils.ts`, which is exactly the fix; until then this copy
 * follows the same rule (lowercase, non-alphanumerics to single hyphens, no
 * leading/trailing hyphen, 60 chars) so the two cannot diverge in behaviour.
