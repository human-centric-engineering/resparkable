/**
 * The stale digest — "you haven't touched Acme since April — still a client?"
 *
 * §11's position, which this file implements literally: **obsolescence is a
 * question, not a rule.** Retention archives what a clock can judge safely
 * (a completed task from last spring); everything where age is a poor proxy for
 * irrelevance comes here instead and gets asked. Nothing in this file writes,
 * except the explicit answer a person gives.
 *
 * The three windows are separate because the questions are not comparable: a
 * project quiet for six weeks probably is dead, and a life goal untouched for a
 * year certainly is not. They are constants rather than user settings on
 * purpose: these tune *how often you are asked something*, and a retention
 * policy screen with a dozen sliders is a screen nobody finishes reading. The
 * eight windows that destroy or hide data are the ones worth exposing.
 *
 * ## Tone
 *
 * §11 says the digest is the one place the agent should be blunt, and that is a
 * product decision with a reason behind it: a digest that softens every row into
 * "you might perhaps want to consider revisiting…" is a digest that never gets
 * a decision out of anyone, so nothing is ever archived and the list grows until
 * it is ignored. The rows this service produces carry facts and dates; the
 * workflow prompt does the wording.
