/**
 * `GET /resparkable/connections` — the review queue, with both ends readable.
 *
 * ## Why `/links` is not enough
 *
 * `GET /resparkable/links` returns the rows as stored: four opaque strings per link,
 * because `ResparkableLink` is polymorphic and has no foreign keys to its endpoints
 * (D2). A review UI cannot render `{ sourceType: 'thought', sourceId: 'clx…' }` —
 * the whole question it asks the user is "should these two things be connected",
 * and it needs to name both things to ask it.
 *
 * The alternative is the client resolving each endpoint itself, which is two
 * requests per row on a page whose entire purpose is a list. So the hydration
 * happens here, one query per distinct type across the whole page.
 *
 * `/links` stays as it is: it is the CRUD surface, and an agent or a script asking
 * for raw rows should get raw rows.
 *
 * ## The default excludes rejected, on purpose
 *
 * A rejected row is a tombstone that stops the sweep re-proposing the pair for ever
 * (§17 risk 5c). It is a fact about the engine, not a connection — showing it in the
 * queue would invite someone to "clean up" the very rows that stop the nagging.
 * `?status=rejected` still returns them for anyone who wants to review a dismissal.
