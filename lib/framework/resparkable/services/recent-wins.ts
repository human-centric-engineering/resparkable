/**
 * What you actually finished — the briefing's opening half.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `plan.md` §6 is blunt about it: _"a planner that only ever shows what's
 * outstanding is a machine for feeling behind"_. So the briefing leads with
 * completions, and this is the query that finds them.
 *
 * It is also the payoff for `ResparkableEvent` existing (§1). The alternative — scan
 * `updatedAt` across five tables and guess which changes were completions — cannot
 * distinguish "I finished this" from "I renamed it", which is the entire point.
 * `services/events.ts` writes `kind: 'completed'` at the moment a status crosses
 * into `done`, so the log already holds the answer.
 *
 * ## Why it is not on the snapshot
 *
 * `SnapshotPayload` looked like the natural home, and it is the wrong one:
 * `context/contributor.ts` calls `buildSnapshot` to build the `LOCKED CONTEXT`
 * block on **every chat turn**. Folding a seven-day event scan plus title
 * hydration into it would charge every message the user sends for a section that
 * one screen reads once a day. The briefing composes the two instead.
 *
 * ## Counts and titles are different facts
 *
 * An event outlives the row it points at — `ResparkableEvent` has no FK to its
 * subject (D2, same reasoning as `ResparkableLink`), so completing a task and then
 * deleting it leaves a completion whose title is gone. That is not an error and
 * the count must not shrink to hide it: you did finish the thing. `total` counts
 * events; `items` carries the ones that still resolve. A caller rendering
 * "3 finished" above two lines is showing the truth, not a bug.
