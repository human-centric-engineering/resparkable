/**
 * Ideation — the active counterpart to the nightly sweep.
 *
 * The sweep *notices* connections on its own schedule. This is a person (or an
 * agent acting for them) asking for them: it pulls the seed's nearest
 * neighbours across every embedded type, then asks a model for N distinct
 * framings — article angles, podcast topics, campaign ideas for a client.
 *
 * **Read-only.** It writes no `ResparkableLink`, no `ResparkableThought`, nothing. That
 * is what lets it be `isIdempotent: true` as a capability and safe to call
 * repeatedly from a UI. The only thing it persists is an `AiCostLog` row, which
 * is accounting, not content.
 *
 * **Two floors, deliberately different.** The sweep's `STRENGTH_FLOOR` (0.55) is
 * tuned to propose connections worth reviewing — a false positive there nags
 * someone every Sunday. Ideation wants the opposite bias: a wider, weaker net,
 * because the interesting framings come from the pairs that are *nearly*
 * unrelated. `findConnections` takes a `strengthFloor` override for exactly
 * this, and the comment on that field says so.
 *
 * **Cost.** One small structured completion per call, bounded by `count` ≤ 10
 * and a hard `maxTokens`. It is the only route in phase 6a that spends money,
 * which is why it carries its own rate-limit sub-cap.
