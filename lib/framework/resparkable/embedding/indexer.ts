/**
 * The indexer — what turns rows into vectors, and the cost gate that keeps it
 * affordable.
 *
 * ## The hash gate
 *
 * `indexedHash` is nulled **liberally**: by every content update, by restore, by
 * an explicit reindex. That looks profligate until you see the order of
 * operations here:
 *
 *   1. fetch candidates (`indexedHash IS NULL`)
 *   2. compute canonical text and hash — pure, free
 *   3. compare against the hash already stored on the entity's chunks
 *   4. **only on a mismatch**, call the embedder
 *   5. stamp `indexedHash` either way
 *
 * So nulling the column queues a *comparison*, not an API call. That is what
 * lets every mutation path null it without knowing which fields are semantic —
 * the alternative was a per-type list of "fields that matter" duplicated at
 * every call site, which would be wrong within a month of someone adding a
 * column. §17 risk 3 is the thing this design is aimed at: a corpus of five
 * thousand notes must not re-embed because a status changed.
 *
 * ## Bounded by design
 *
 * `reindexPending` takes a limit and returns counts. It never loops until done.
 * Callers are a fire-and-forget hop after capture, a manual `POST /reindex`, and
 * (phase 7) the nightly workflow — none of which should be able to spend an
 * unbounded amount of money in one call, and all of which are happy to make
 * progress and come back.
