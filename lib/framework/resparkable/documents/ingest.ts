/**
 * Document ingestion — parse, chunk, embed, and decide what to do with the bytes.
 *
 * ## What this reuses, and what it deliberately doesn't
 *
 * The parsing and chunking is the platform's, wholesale: `parseDocument()`
 * already handles PDF, DOCX, EPUB, CSV, HTML, TXT and MD, and the chunker has
 * been through the CSV-row and semantic-breakpoint cases. Re-deriving either
 * would be weeks of work to arrive somewhere worse.
 *
 * What it does **not** reuse is the knowledge base itself.
 * `.context/orchestration/knowledge.md` is explicit that the KB is a global asset
 * and that per-user scoping there is an anti-pattern — so the rows land in
 * `ResparkableDocument` / `ResparkableEmbedding`, inside the `WHERE userId = $1`
 * invariant (plan §4). Same parsers, same chunker, app-owned tables: that is the
 * whole distinction.
 *
 * ## The bytes
 *
 * By default the original file is parsed and then **dropped**. See
 * `resolveDocumentOriginals` for why that is the safe default rather than the
 * lazy one — briefly: not every provider can hold an object privately or read it
 * back, and retaining on one that cannot would publish people's documents.
 * Retention is an operator setting gated on the provider's declared
 * `capabilities`, and when it is on the stored URL is never returned to a
 * client; downloads go through a short-lived signed URL.
