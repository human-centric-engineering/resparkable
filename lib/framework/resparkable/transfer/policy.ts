/**
 * Transfer policy for the brain.
 *
 * The read half of this already exists — `repo/subject-export.ts` answers "what
 * is this person owed?" for GDPR Art. 15. This answers the harder question:
 * what can be written back into a *different* account, and what happens to
 * everything that pointed at something by id.
 *
 * ## Data only, on purpose
 *
 * This file imports no database client and calls nothing. It is a declaration
 * that the generic engine in `lib/portability/**` reads. That keeps it inside
 * the tier's ESLint boundary (only `repo/**` may reach Prisma) without needing
 * an exemption, and it means the whole policy can be unit-tested as a value.
 *
 * ## What is special about this tier
 *
 * Every table hangs off `ResparkableSpace` through `userId`, which is
 * simultaneously the owner column and the foreign key to the space row. So the
 * space must be written first, and every other table's ownership is rewritten by
 * changing one column. That is why the brain is the easy half of a transfer —
 * and why the hard part is everything that refers to a row *without* a foreign
 * key behind it.
 *
 * @see lib/portability/policy.ts — what each field means
 * @see lib/framework/resparkable/repo/subject-export.ts — the Art. 15 half
 * @see .context/framework/resparkable/transfer.md
