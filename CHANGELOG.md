## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Phase 9 closes Release 1: PWA install, image capture, and email-to-inbox.**
  `app/manifest.ts` (content in `lib/framework/resparkable/pwa/manifest.ts`)
  makes `/resparkable` installable, with an Android share target (`GET
  /resparkable/capture?title=&text=&url=`) landing on a new page
  (`app/(protected)/resparkable/capture/`). `POST /api/v1/resparkable/transcribe/image`
  is a new one-shot vision-extraction route for the capture box's camera
  button — no original photo persisted, same as voice. A new capability,
  `resparkable_capture_for_token`, resolves its owner from a Postmark
  inbound email's routing token rather than a session, bound to a new
  chat-unreachable `resparkable-intake` agent; `resparkable-capture-intake`
  is a new workflow, fired by a Postmark `AiWorkflowTrigger` row instead of a
  schedule. `ResparkableThought.source` values `'voice'`, `'image'` and
  `'pwa'` are now actually produced (`THOUGHT_SOURCES` already listed them
  since phase 1). See [`capture-channels.md`](./.context/framework/resparkable/capture-channels.md).

- **`SparkMesh`, `SparkGlyph`/`SparkRule` and `VerbDiagram`: the mark, opened
  out into the graph it is drawn from.** `components/brand/spark-mesh.tsx` draws
  the lemniscate as eleven vertices and twelve facets inside a wider field of far
  nodes, with a pulse lapping the loop, the vertices lighting as it reaches them,
  and three far nodes catching shortly after the spark crosses the centre, while
  the crossing does not dim to pay for it. Server Components throughout: every
  moving part is `opacity`, `transform` or `stroke-dashoffset`, so there is no
  rAF loop, no client bundle and no hydration.

  Timing lives in the new `components/brand/geometry.ts` beside the vertex table
  that computes it. The facets are not equal lengths (14.213 / 11 / 13.601 per
  lobe), so evenly-spaced flashes drift visibly out of step with the pulse by the
  far lobe. That module is also now the single source for `LOOP_PATH` and
  `SPARK_PATH`; `BrandMark` reads them from there instead of carrying its own
  copies.

- **A continuous-motion exception, fenced to the public pages.** `brand-theme.css`
  gains `.spark-trace`, `.spark-node`, `.spark-mote`, `.spark-relay` and
  `.spark-core`, driven by `--spark-lap` / `--spark-phase`. The app's one-arrival-
  then-stillness rule is unchanged everywhere else: a thing that moves while you
  are trying to think is a thing you end up hiding. All five freeze at a legible
  resting state under `prefers-reduced-motion`, so the graphic degrades to a
  still diagram rather than vanishing.

- **A brand sheet at `/resparkable/brand`, and the mark it documents.** Nine SVGs
  in `public/brand/` (lockup and mark, each adaptive / ember / vermilion /
  `currentColor`, plus a tile icon), generated from
  `scripts/framework/resparkable/build-brand.py`. The wordmark is Martian Mono 600
  converted to outlines, so the lockups carry no font dependency.

  The adaptive files switch on `prefers-color-scheme` and carry the light palette
  as presentation attributes beneath the CSS variables, so renderers without
  `var()` support (librsvg, most image pipelines) land on the light palette rather
  than on black. Pin a variant wherever the ground is fixed.

  The page's swatches are filled from `var(--color-*)` and captioned by token name
  rather than hex, so it reports whatever the palette currently is instead of a
  snapshot of it. Documented in
  `.context/framework/resparkable/brand-assets.md`.

- **The app icon is wired through the Next `app/icon.svg` convention.**
  `public/favicon.svg` existed but nothing linked it, so browsers were falling
  back to `public/favicon.ico`, which is now regenerated from the mark at six
  resolutions (16→256).

### Changed

- **The three verbs are now catch, kindle, ignite.** They were catch, carry,
  pass on, which was three unrelated things you do with your hands; this is one
  metaphor followed through. "Carry" fixed the storage claim but not the verb
  (carrying is something you do to luggage), and the overnight pass is closer to
  kindling anyway: give a caught spark air, put it next to the other dry thing in
  the pile, bring it back warm. The third verb carries the page's whole argument
  so it now uses the strongest word available. "Spark it." was rejected for the
  first verb: *spark* is already the app's noun for a caught idea, and the verb
  would claim you generate the thing, which is the opposite of what `/about`
  argues. `VerbDiagram`'s `kind` prop renames with it
  (`'carry' | 'pass'` → `'kindle' | 'ignite'`), and the landing headline is now
  the whole arc in one sentence: "Catch and kindle the spark of an idea, then
  ignite others" (it was "Catch an idea in one line. Get it back when it
  matters."). The `h1` drops one size step at every breakpoint to carry it.

- **The public pages argue the opposite of what they used to.** The landing
  headline was "Never lose a good idea." (loss-aversion, which is this genre's
  default pitch and frames a thought as property you are richer for holding). It
  now states what the product does instead of what you stand to lose, the three
  verbs are **catch, carry, pass on** (the middle one was "Keep it."), a
  statement band carries the line the rest of the page follows from, and
  `/about` opens on "Nobody owns an idea." with a new section on the difference
  between having a thought and living with one. `BrandMark`, `SparkGlyph` and `SparkMesh` appear across the hero,
  every section rail, the statement band, the closing calls to action and a new
  `FooterBand` above the platform footer.

- **The landing page no longer claims withdrawable share links.** "Send an idea,
  a project or a whole board to the people who should see it, with a link that
  stays yours to withdraw" described something that does not exist: there is no
  share model in the schema, and `/`'s own "where this goes" section lists shared
  projects and boards as ahead. `Pass it on.` now rests on what is real (markdown
  export that carries your edits, an assistant that drafts the sendable version)
  and the collaboration claim stays where it belongs, in the forward-looking
  section.

- **The goals feature no longer advertises weekly area targets.** Copy still
  promised that "the areas of your life carry a weekly target, so the one you
  have been neglecting comes back into view" (a description of
  `targetWeeklyMinutes`, removed in the life-areas change, and of exactly the
  framing `.context/framework/resparkable/design-principles.md` now rules out).

- **`BrandMark` renders the loop-and-spark mark instead of the split shard.** One
  change reaches every header: `AppHeader` serves both `(protected)` and
  `(public)`, and the auth layout renders the slot directly.

  The mark stays a single `currentColor` silhouette rather than the gradient the
  standalone files in `public/brand/` carry. A gradient would pin the header to
  the consumer accent and silently break the `/admin` teal swap, and at 18px no
  one can see a ramp. For the same reason the spark is not a second opacity of
  the accent: two opacities of one colour over near-black go muddy; a mask clears
  a hairline of ground around the spark and the silhouette does the separating.

  Still a fork-owned scaffold: the stable contract is the export, not the body.

- **Light mode's accent is vermilion `#c2410c`, not indigo `#4338ca`.** Both modes
  now run one fire at two temperatures: the new primary sits 9° (OKLCH) from
  `#a3480a`, the tail of the ember ramp dark mode already used.

  This reverses a documented decision, so the reasoning is worth stating. The old
  argument, that any warm accent dark enough for paper reads as brown, was true
  of *yellow-orange*: `#b45309` is hue 49°, chroma 0.146, and light mode ran it
  once and looked like a filing cabinet. The escape is hue rather than lightness.
  `#c2410c` is hue 38°, chroma 0.174: redder and more saturated. It reads as fire.

  **Two signals moved with it, and forks that re-skin will want to check theirs.**
  The warm slot on paper is crowded: `destructive` sat at hue 17° and `warn` at
  66°, leaving any warm accent no more than ~24° from each, against the 34° this
  palette already tolerates at its worst. So `--color-destructive` moved
  `#be123c` → `#96123f` (29° clear, and its own contrast improves 6.3:1 → 8.6:1)
  and `--color-warn` moved `#a16207` → `#936f00` (48° clear). `--color-sheen` was
  left alone at 74° of separation, though the reason it was pushed to fuchsia (not
  reading as a slightly-off indigo) has now lifted.

  **The neutrals were re-hued from an indigo cast to a warm one** (~52° at their
  original lightness): cool greys under a warm accent read as dirty. No contrast
  ratio dropped: `foreground` holds 17.1:1 and `muted-foreground` 6.4:1.

  One regression, stated plainly: link text falls from 7.9:1 to 5.18:1. Still AA at
  body size, no longer AAA. No arrangement of a warm hue on paper avoids it.

  Nothing outside `app/brand-theme.css` hardcoded these values, so the change is
  confined to the token block. Rationale lives in `.context/ui/design-language.md`.

- **Administrators can transfer an account on its owner's behalf.** `POST
  /api/v1/admin/users/[id]/transfer` queues an export (JSON body) or an import
  (multipart with `file`) for the named user; `GET` lists that account's
  transfers; `GET /api/v1/admin/transfer/jobs/[id]` polls one and mints the
  signed download; `DELETE` drops the archive early.

  Legitimate operator work — fulfilling a subject access request, moving an
  account to a new install, rescuing a botched import — and the most sensitive
  thing this subsystem can do. Three controls, none optional:

  **API keys are refused**, even though `withAdminAuth` accepts an admin-scoped
  one for headless use. Keys are self-service and long-lived, and "read out any
  user's entire account" should not be reachable from one left in a CI config.

  **Every request writes an audit entry**, before the response and for the
  request rather than its outcome: `transfer.export`, `transfer.import`,
  `transfer.download`, `transfer.discard`. The download is audited separately
  from the export that produced it, because queueing one and never fetching it is
  a different fact from taking it away — and only the second moved anybody's
  data.

  **`TransferJob.initiatedBy`** (new column, `SetNull`) is returned on the
  *subject's* own transfer list. An audit log answers to the operator and the
  subject cannot see it; this is what makes "an administrator exported your
  account on the 3rd" visible to the person it happened to. `DELETE` marks the
  job `expired` rather than removing the row, so that evidence cannot be tidied
  away, and `SetNull` means erasing the administrator de-attributes it rather
  than destroying it.

  The poll route is scoped to jobs **this administrator started**, not to "any
  job, because you are an admin" — so reading another account's data stays
  something you have to start, and starting it is what gets recorded. There is
  deliberately no synchronous admin export: that shape has no expiry, no audit of
  the download as distinct from the request, and nothing to point at afterwards.
  The one-in-flight limit is scoped by subject rather than by caller.

  Changed public surface: `TransferJob` gains `initiatedBy` and a
  `TransferJobInitiator` relation on `User`; `EnqueueExportParams` and
  `EnqueueImportParams` gain an optional `initiatedBy` (the new `OnBehalfOf`
  interface); the self-service job list and single-job routes now return
  `initiatedBy`. `scripts/smoke/erasure.ts` covers both policies on the model —
  a subject's own transfer cascades, one they started for somebody else is
  retained and de-attributed.

- **Account transfers can be prepared in the background.** `POST
  /api/v1/users/me/transfer/jobs` queues an export (JSON body) or an import
  (multipart body with a `file` field); `GET` lists your own; `GET …/[id]` polls
  one and, for a finished export, returns a short-lived signed download link;
  `DELETE …/[id]` drops the stored archive early.

  Both synchronous endpoints have a ceiling set by how long a request may stay
  open rather than by anything about the data, which means a large account cannot
  move at all — failing exactly the people with the most to move. The worker runs
  **the same functions** those routes run, with the same arguments; the only
  difference is `BACKGROUND_APPLY_CAPS` (500,000 rows and a ten-minute
  transaction, against 50,000 and one minute).

  **The single transaction is unchanged.** A background import still refuses
  rather than half-writing. Chunking it into a resumable job would trade away the
  guarantee that makes this safe to point at a real account, in exchange for a
  ceiling almost nobody reaches.

  The archive lives in private blob storage, never in the job row — a `Bytes`
  column would put every export into Postgres, its backups and every replica. The
  download link is signed and minted per poll (15 minutes), never stored. The
  object is deleted after 7 days and the job marked `expired`; an import's
  uploaded bundle is deleted as soon as its job is terminal. `eraseUser()` now
  drops the whole `transfer-jobs/<userId>/` prefix, because the rows cascade and
  the archives would not.

  Refusals happen at enqueue rather than at run: an installation without private,
  signable blob storage is told immediately, and one transfer per person at a
  time.

  New model: `TransferJob` (`transfer_job`), `onDelete: Cascade`, `skip` in the
  transfer manifest (importing one would resurrect a job pointing at another
  installation's bucket) and `export` in the Art. 15 manifest with `storageKey`
  omitted.

  Two new maintenance-tick tasks, appended to `PLATFORM_JOB_NAMES` and therefore
  to the tick route's published `backgroundTasks`: `transferJobs` (every tick —
  one job per tick, so cadence is throughput) and `transferArchiveExpiry`
  (hourly). A job whose lease goes stale is **failed, not re-claimed** — unlike
  the evaluation-run worker, there is no cursor to resume an apply from, and
  re-running one could duplicate an account.

  New public surface: `BACKGROUND_APPLY_CAPS` and the `ApplyCaps` type;
  `ApplyImportParams.caps` and `ApplyAccountImportParams.caps`;
  `enqueueExportJob`, `enqueueImportJob`, `TransferJobError`;
  `processTransferJobs`, `expireTransferArchives`; the `archive-store` helpers;
  `transferExportJobSchema` and `transferImportJobSchema`.

- **Uploaded files travel with an account export.** `GET
  /api/v1/users/me/transfer/export?originals=true` now carries the documents
  themselves, not only the text extracted from them, and `POST
  /api/v1/users/me/transfer/import` stores them at the far end and writes the row's
  storage key from where they actually landed.

  A storage key is the one column that cannot simply be copied: it addresses an
  object in a bucket the importing installation may have no credentials for, under
  a path built from another account's user id. Copied across it yields a row that
  looks complete and resolves to nothing, so the key stays `reset` to null and only
  the **bytes** travel.

  Opt-in on the way out — originals are the only incompressible part of a bundle,
  and including them by default would make the ordinary export of a
  document-heavy account a download that times out. The manifest records the
  choice either way (`originals.requested`), because "not asked for", "none here"
  and "dropped" otherwise produce identical directory listings and only one of
  them means something is missing. Every file that was asked for and could not
  travel is listed with its reason.

  Refusable on the way in, independently: an installation whose operator set
  `documentOriginals: discard` has decided not to hold people's files, and an
  import is not a way around that. Files are written only for rows the plan is
  **creating** — a record matching one already here keeps the original it already
  had — and are uploaded **before** the transaction opens, so no row is ever
  inserted with a key that is missing or wrong. A failed upload costs its own file
  and a warning, never the import.

  New public surface: `OriginalsPolicy` on `TransferPolicy` (`keyColumn`,
  `contentTypeColumn`); `OriginalsStore` and the `ORIGINALS_STORES` registry in
  `lib/portability/originals-io.ts`, which a fork implements to say where its own
  model's files go; `ORIGINALS_CAPS`; `TransferFormatSpec.carriesOriginals` and
  the matching field on `TransferFormatSummary`.

  Changed public surface: `BundleManifest` gains `originals`; `TransferBundle`
  gains `blobs`; `Rendering`'s archive variant gains an optional `blobs`;
  `IncomingBundle` gains `originals`; `buildTransferArchive` takes a third `blobs`
  argument; `ApplyImportParams` takes an optional `originals`; `ApplyResult` gains
  `originals`; `AccountExport` gains `originals`; `AccountImportPlan` gains
  `originalsAvailable`. The bundle format version is **unchanged at 1** — a
  manifest without an `originals` block reads as "carried none", which is exactly
  what every bundle written before this was.

  Two new response headers on the export route: `X-Transfer-Originals` and
  `X-Transfer-Originals-Omitted`, so a UI can report a partial answer as partial
  without unzipping the download.

  The coverage guard now fails for a model that declares `originals` without
  resetting its key column to null, and for one that declares it with no
  `OriginalsStore` registered — a policy claiming files travel with nothing at the
  far end would export the bytes and drop every one of them, reporting nothing.

- **`conflictMode: 'overwrite'` on account import.** `POST
  /api/v1/users/me/transfer/import` now honours both modes. `skip` remains the
  default and remains unchanged: a record matching one the account already has is
  left exactly as it is. `overwrite` writes the bundle's values into the row it
  matched — **but only where the match came from a real unique constraint.** A row
  found through a `softMergeKey` is left alone exactly as `skip` leaves it,
  because that key is a guess and the plan has no way yet to say yes to one
  individually.

  Three things a create writes that an overwrite does not. `mint` columns are
  **not re-issued** — minting is how a redacted column gets a value at all, and
  doing it to an existing row would rotate a live credential and silently move
  where somebody's email capture arrives. The owner column is not written: the row
  was found through an owner-scoped read, and where the owner column _is_ the
  primary key (`User`) writing it would be an attempt to move the row. `reset`
  columns _are_ still forced, so a row that was written into is re-indexed rather
  than left with a digest of its old text. `regenerate` is excluded in both modes,
  which is what keeps this from being a one-file privilege escalation.

  Both modes share one column-mapping function, so "an overwrite writes the values
  a create would" holds by construction rather than by two functions agreeing.
  Overwrites count against the same `APPLY_CAPS.maxRows` as inserts — each is its
  own round trip where inserts go a thousand at a time.

  Changed public surface: `AppliedModel` and `ApplyResult.totals` gain
  `overwritten`.

- **`ResparkableGoal.slug`, with `@@unique([userId, slug])`.** Goals were the last
  named type in the brain without one, and it was not cosmetic. `vault/`'s
  importer excluded goals from `SLUG_IDENTITY_TYPES` for want of a constraint, so
  a hand-written `Goals/…md` note created a **second** goal on every import, for
  ever; and the account importer had to fall back to a guessed key, which is what
  blocked `overwrite` above. The vault had always filed a goal at
  `Goals/<horizon>/<slug>.md`, deriving that slug from the title on the way out and
  discarding it — so the address existed and was simply not stored.

  Migration `20260807220000_resparkable_goal_slug` backfills with the same rule
  `services/slug.ts` mints by and de-duplicates the way `resolveUniqueSlug` does
  (oldest keeps the bare slug, later ones take `-2`, `-3`), then adds the index.
  Matching the other three named types: `createGoalSchema` accepts an optional
  `slug`, `goalResource.create` resolves one from the title, a retitle does **not**
  move it (`resolveSlugOnUpdate`), and the agent-facing
  `resparkable_upsert_goal` does not accept one at all.

  New public surface: `findGoalBySlug()` in
  `lib/framework/resparkable/repo/goals.ts`. Changed: `ResparkableGoal` gains a
  required `slug`; `GoalSource` in `vault/notes.ts` gains `slug`, and a goal note's
  frontmatter now carries it; `ResparkableGoal`'s transfer policy trades its
  `softMergeKey` for `mergeKeys: [['userId', 'slug']]`.

- **Account import can now write.** `POST /api/v1/users/me/transfer/import`
  takes `apply=true` and `conflictMode`, and writes the plan it just produced.
  Dry run remains the default — an import is not reversible and the plan is
  free, so the safe reading of silence is "show me".

  `conflictMode: 'skip'` is the only mode this version honours: a record matching
  one the account already has is **left exactly as it is**, and everything that
  referred to the bundle's copy is pointed at the record already here — so
  importing an export into an account that already has an area called Health
  files the bundle's projects under the existing one. `overwrite` (Phase F) is
  refused by the applier with a reason rather than by a validator. Both values
  are `importAgentsSchema`'s, so there is one vocabulary for this question across
  the codebase; note that `mergeKeys` is how a collision is *found* and
  `conflictMode` is what is *done* about it.

  The applier makes no decisions — every one arrives on `ImportPlan.resolved`
  from the planner, so the dry run and the write cannot disagree. **Every id is
  minted before anything is written**, rather than reading generated ids back
  from a bulk insert, because matching returned rows to input rows means trusting
  a result ordering no database promises — and a permutation would attach
  somebody's tasks to the wrong project while violating nothing. The whole import
  runs in **one transaction** with a row cap that refuses rather than
  half-writing, and a row pointing into its own table is written with that column
  empty and linked afterwards.

  A model whose owner column *is* its primary key (`User`) is never created,
  matched or not — an import lands on the account doing it rather than creating a
  person.

  New public surface: `lib/portability/apply-import.ts` (`applyImportPlan()`,
  `ApplyResult`, `ConflictMode`, `TransferApplyError`, `APPLY_CAPS`),
  `applyAccountImport()` in `lib/portability/import-account.ts`,
  `accountImportSchema` in `lib/portability/validation.ts`, and
  `isWritableScalar()` plus `ImportPlan.resolved` / `ResolvedRow` in
  `lib/portability/import-plan.ts`.

### Fixed

- **`redact` could produce a table an import cannot write.** A column dropped on
  the way out that is required and undefaulted on the way in leaves nothing to
  write — `ResparkableSpace.inboxToken`, a bearer token routing email capture,
  was exactly that, so no import could create a space. `TransferPolicy` gains
  **`mint`**, a per-column generator declared in the tier that owns the column,
  and the coverage guard now fails for any column that is redacted, required and
  undefaulted without one. `ImportPlan` also reports `missingRequired` per table,
  so a dry run says which records could not be written rather than leaving the
  apply to discover it.

- **Account import, dry run: what would this bundle do?** New
  `POST /api/v1/users/me/transfer/import` takes a bundle produced by the export
  endpoint and returns a plan. **Nothing is written** — an `apply` field is
  refused rather than ignored, because a caller who sends it believes rows are
  being written. Browser sessions only (an API key of any scope gets a 403,
  matching the export endpoint), with an `uploadLimiter` sub-cap and a 64 MB
  upload ceiling checked before the body is read.

  A bundle's **owner column is overwritten, never read**, so every row lands on
  the account doing the importing whatever the file says; ids in a bundle are
  claims resolved through an owner-scoped read, never addresses. Identity goes
  `mergeKeys` → `softMergeKey` → create, and a match made on a guessed key is
  named individually in the plan so it can be vetoed. Two records never merge
  onto one existing row — the second becomes a new row and is reported.

  Tables are visited in a topological order over the generated model graph in
  which **soft and `Json` references count as dependencies**, so a row dropped
  for want of a reference it cannot do without takes its dependents with it
  without a second pass. References into a row's own table, edges deferred to
  break a cycle, and whole-value `Json` references are resolved in a final
  read-only sweep, alongside the **cuid canary** — which reports ids sitting in
  `Json` positions the policy manifest does not declare, and never rewrites
  them. Every capped detail list carries its true total.

  Reading is defended where the cost lands: caps run inside the fflate filter
  callback before any entry is inflated, only `manifest.json` and `data/*.json`
  are ever decompressed, and a cap breach rejects the whole archive rather than
  truncating it. A data file the manifest does not vouch for is ignored and
  reported, so "models opt in" survives somebody editing the zip.

  New public surface: `lib/portability/read-bundle.ts`
  (`readTransferBundle()`, `TransferBundleError`, `BUNDLE_READ_CAPS`),
  `lib/portability/write-order.ts` (`writeOrder()`, `WriteOrder`,
  `DependencyEdge`), `lib/portability/json-paths.ts` (`walkJsonStrings()`,
  `jsonStringsAt()`, `jsonPathCovers()`, `canaryScan()`, `JSON_WALK_CAPS`),
  `lib/portability/import-plan.ts` (`buildImportPlan()`, `ImportPlan`,
  `ExistingLookup`, `mergeKeyOf()`, `PLAN_CAPS`),
  `lib/portability/import-lookup.ts` (`createExistingLookup()`,
  `TransferLookupError`, `LOOKUP_CAPS`) and
  `lib/portability/import-account.ts` (`planAccountImport()`).
  `lib/portability/collect.ts` now exports `orderById()`, previously private, so
  the export and import paths share one definition of a stable row order.

- **Export formats: Logseq, Notion, CSV and a one-page digest.**
  `GET /api/v1/users/me/transfer/export` takes a new `?format=` — `bundle`
  (default, unchanged), `logseq`, `notion`, `csv` or `digest` — and the **Your
  data** tab offers them as a picker. A renderer receives the rows the collector
  already gathered and returns files; it never touches the database, so no
  format can widen what leaves an account.

  `bundle` remains the only format an import will be able to read back. The
  others are one-way renderings for other tools and each says so in its own
  README: `logseq` writes a graph (`pages/`, `journals/`, `logseq/config.edn`)
  with tasks as `TODO` blocks under their project rather than as pages, because
  that is what Logseq's agenda and queries read; `notion` writes CSV databases
  and markdown pages laid out for Notion's importer, with every reference as the
  target's **name** rather than an id, since Notion creates no relations on
  import; `csv` writes one spreadsheet per table alongside the same manifest and
  README the JSON bundle carries; `digest` is a single Markdown document, sent as
  itself rather than as a zip of one file.

  A format that covers only part of an account — `logseq` and `notion` render
  the brain — **refuses** a `?groups=` asking for the rest rather than quietly
  narrowing it, and the UI disables those sections so the refusal is a backstop
  rather than the way somebody finds out. The digest prints every table's true
  row count and says how many records it is not showing.

  New public surface: `lib/portability/format.ts` (`TransferFormatSpec`,
  `TRANSFER_FORMATS`, `transferFormatSummaries()`, `resolveFormatGroups()`,
  `TransferFormatError`), `lib/portability/formats/{json-bundle,csv,digest}.ts`,
  and `lib/framework/resparkable/transfer/{brain-view,formats/logseq,formats/notion}.ts`.
  `lib/api/csv.ts` gains `csvDocument()`. `AccountExportPanel` gains a required
  `formats` prop and `SettingsTabs` a required `transferFormats`.

- **Account export: take your data with you.** New
  `GET /api/v1/users/me/transfer/export` returns the calling account as a zip —
  `manifest.json`, a plain-English `README.md`, and one `data/<Model>.json` per
  table. `?groups=brain,conversations` narrows it; a new **Your data** tab in
  Settings offers the same choice as checkboxes. Browser sessions only (an API
  key of any scope gets a 403, matching the Art. 15 endpoint), with an
  `exportLimiter` sub-cap. Archives are reproducible — one `mtime` across every
  entry — so two exports of an unchanged account differ only where the account
  differs.

  New `lib/portability/collect.ts` finds the rows, which is the hard half: only
  39 of the 57 exportable models carry an owner column. It runs a repeated
  **down** pass from the owner columns along foreign keys, then a single
  terminal **up** pass that pulls in the shared rows collected data points at.
  The up pass does not walk back down, because one step down from a shared row
  is other accounts' data — and for the same reason a model that declares an
  `ownerColumn` is only ever collected by asking for that owner's rows, never
  reached by an edge. Anything neither pass reaches is named in the manifest
  with a reason, because a missing table and an empty table look identical in a
  file listing. Also new: `bundle.ts` (pure — manifest and README),
  `archive.ts` (zip, fails before allocating when over cap),
  `export-account.ts`, and `transferGroupSummaries()` on the registry.

- **A generated model graph, and the transfer-policy vocabulary built on it.**
  Groundwork for account export/import — moving one person's data into a
  different account or a self-hosted install. New `generator portability` block
  emits `lib/portability/model-graph.generated.ts` on every `prisma generate`: a
  machine-readable description of all ~80 models — foreign keys, uniques,
  nullability, `Json` columns, `Unsupported()` columns, and reference-shaped
  columns with no foreign key behind them. It has to be generated rather than
  read at runtime because Prisma 7's `Prisma.dmmf` is pruned to
  `{name, kind, type, relationName}` and carries no foreign-key metadata at all.
  New `lib/portability/policy.ts` declares the vocabulary (`transfer` /
  `export-only` / `skip`, redactions, merge keys, soft references, `Json` id
  paths); `core-policies.ts` and `lib/framework/resparkable/transfer/policy.ts`
  classify every existing table. New fork seam `lib/app/data-transfer.ts` ships
  empty and is wired through `lib/portability/registry.ts`. New dev dependency
  `@prisma/generator-helper`, declared directly rather than relied on
  transitively. No export or import route yet — see
  `.context/framework/resparkable/transfer.md` for the phase plan.

  The rule the whole thing runs on is deliberately asymmetric: **columns opt
  out, models opt in.** A new column joins the bundle by default (the same
  reason `export-sources.ts` uses Prisma `omit` and never `select`); a new model
  fails `tests/unit/lib/portability/policy-coverage.test.ts` until somebody
  classifies it, with the failure naming the exact file to edit. A second guard
  fails on any `String` column whose name looks like credential material and
  which has not been explicitly redacted, regenerated, or excused in writing.

- **`PublicSection` and `LandingHero`: the marketing pages' own layout units.**
  New `components/marketing/resparkable/`, a fork-owned subfolder that upstream
  never writes to, so `components/marketing/` stays free to keep improving.
  `PublicSection` is the one section unit the public pages are built from: a
  sticky four-column heading rail beside eight columns of content, collapsing to
  a stacked heading below `lg`, plus `NumberedItem` for the lists inside it.
  `LandingHero` is the landing page's opening block. The six public pages
  (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/terms`, `/privacy`) are rewritten on top of both,
  describing the product rather than the starter template underneath it.

- **`SparkWordmark` and `.spark-lit` — the name, set as its three parts.** New
  `components/brand/spark-wordmark.tsx` renders `re` (muted) · `spark` (primary,
  lit) · `able` (foreground), and falls back to the whole name in one colour
  when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` is set to something else — splitting is a property
  of *this* name. `.spark-lit` (in `app/brand-theme.css`, documented in
  [`.context/ui/design-language.md`](./.context/ui/design-language.md)) is the
  accompanying halo; it draws in `--obs-bloom`, so it is visible on glass and
  absent on paper without a `.dark` variant. `BrandMark` now composes it, and its
  mark is a **split** shard with light in the seam. Both files are fork-owned
  scaffold — the stable contract is the export, not the syllables.

- **Resparkable: your brain as a folder of markdown, out and back in.** The Obsidian
  on-ramp from plan §14, without a live sync engine — phase 15 plus the zip half
  of 17. New `lib/framework/resparkable/vault/**`:
  `layout.ts` (folder set, path safety, filenames), `markdown.ts` (frontmatter
  codec over `yaml@2`), `frontmatter.ts` (per-type Zod schemas), `notes.ts`
  (encode/decode, the project checkbox block), `zip.ts` (`fflate`, with the
  decompression caps), `export.ts`, `import-plan.ts` and `import.ts`. Two routes:
  `GET /api/v1/resparkable/vault/export` (returns a **zip**, the one Resparkable endpoint
  whose body is a file) and `POST /api/v1/resparkable/vault/import` (multipart). A
  page at `/resparkable/vault`, a nav entry, `RESPARKABLE_API.VAULT_EXPORT` /
  `VAULT_IMPORT`, `RESPARKABLE_ROUTES.VAULT`, a 10/hour `resparkable-vault` rate-limit
  tier, and `'vault'` added to `THOUGHT_SOURCES`.

  **Two new direct dependencies, both named in the plan: `yaml` and `fflate`.**
  Both were already present transitively; declaring them is the point —
  free-riding on another package's copy is one `npm update` from a build failure.
  `gray-matter` is deliberately skipped: 40 lines over `yaml@2` gives control of
  BOM, CRLF and delimiter handling, and `yaml@2` preserves formatting when
  rewriting frontmatter in a file somebody edits by hand.

  **An export of an empty brain is the starter vault**, because it is the same
  code path — folder skeleton, README describing the frontmatter contract, a
  minimal `.obsidian/`, and `.brain/manifest.json`. There is no second generator
  to rot.

  **The importer's index is built from the exporter's own encoders**, so
  *export → re-import is a no-op* holds by construction rather than by two field
  lists that could drift. Change detection compares **normalised** forms — key
  order, quote style, CRLF and trailing newlines are invisible to it, which §14
  blames for ~80% of reported conflicts elsewhere.

  **`resparkable-id` is a claim, never an address.** It is resolved through an index
  built from an owner-scoped read, so an id belonging to another user is simply
  absent and the note becomes a new row — plan §16.7's single most important sync
  test, asserted directly. The same rule covers the `^bt-` block ids in a project
  note's checkbox block. A note carrying **no** id — one written in Obsidian
  rather than exported — falls back to matching on slug, for areas, projects and
  entities only, so importing the same hand-authored file twice updates it rather
  than duplicating it. The fallback goes through the same owner-scoped index, and
  the types without a per-owner-unique slug are excluded rather than guessed at.

  **Nothing here deletes.** A row absent from the archive is left alone; the
  nearest import comes to data loss is blanking a body, which is refused unless
  the user ticks a box. Dry-run is the default and costs nothing, because the
  plan is computed either way. `Reviews/` and `Documents/` are export-only, and
  `archived:` is written but appears in no type's writable-key list, so a vault
  edit can never pull an item out of semantic search.

  Not in scope, and unchanged from the plan: no `ResparkableVault*` tables, no
  three-way merge base, no scheduling, no credentials, no git or cloud-drive
  transports. Those are §14's Release 4.

- **Resparkable: the capture box became a sidekick.** `<ResparkableSidekick>`
  (`components/resparkable/layout/resparkable-sidekick.tsx`) replaces the 18rem capture
  card in the shell's grid with a fixed, full-height, resizable drawer that
  overlays the page instead of narrowing it — the board, the graph and the
  planner get their width back, and the capture box gets room to think in.
  Width and open state persist; `⌘K` opens it and lands the caret in the box;
  pointing anywhere else closes it **without swallowing that click**. Closing
  parks the panel (`inert`) rather than unmounting it, so a stray click cannot
  bin a half-written thought.

  Two new endpoints back it. **`POST /api/v1/resparkable/transcribe`** is the
  consumer-side sibling of the platform's admin-only transcribe route — it
  reuses `validateTranscribeUpload` / `getAudioProvider` / `logCost`, resolves
  the companion agent server-side for cost attribution (a browser-supplied
  `agentId` is overwritten), honours the org-wide `voiceInputGloballyEnabled`
  kill switch, deliberately does **not** gate on any agent's
  `enableVoiceInput` (that flag governs a chat surface; this microphone
  addresses no agent), and persists no audio. New `resparkable-audio` rate-limit
  tier, 10/min per session user.

  **`POST /api/v1/resparkable/documents/extract`** parses a file and returns its
  text **without storing anything** — the other half of an ad-hoc attachment,
  where the destination is the capture box rather than the document library. A
  separate route rather than a flag on `/documents` because the two make
  different promises about what is kept. Capped at 20 000 characters with
  `characters`/`truncated` describing the whole document. Inherits the
  `resparkable-upload` cap (20/hour).

  Transport for uploads moved to `components/resparkable/documents/upload-request.ts`
  (`uploadDocument`), shared by the Documents page and the drawer.
  `RESPARKABLE_API` gains `TRANSCRIBE` and `DOCUMENTS_EXTRACT`.
- **Resparkable: every section explains itself.** New
  `lib/framework/resparkable/ui/section-help.ts` (`RESPARKABLE_SECTION_HELP`,
  `findSectionHelp`) holds a per-section title, one-line blurb and ⓘ body, and
  the new `<SectionHeader>` renders it from the Resparkable shell — so a surface is
  documented once, for every route, rather than fifteen times or not at all.
  The copy answers the question no screen was answering — **how do things get
  here** (the four ways to capture into the inbox, the 03:15 triage run, the
  similarity comparison behind Connections) and what a control actually does
  (rejecting a suggestion is what stops it returning; an area with no weekly
  target has no effect on 15% of every task's score). Help text is plain,
  neutral English by rule, and states numbers rather than paraphrasing them.
  `RESPARKABLE_NAV_ITEMS` is now exported so a test fails when a section is added
  without an explanation.
- **Resparkable phase 7b — the brain, from outside the app.** Eight capabilities and
  three slash-command prompts are exposed over MCP
  (`prisma/seeds/framework-resparkable/006-mcp.ts`, written from the manifest at
  `lib/framework/resparkable/mcp/exposure.ts`), so "what should I work on today?" and
  "capture that" work from inside Claude Code. **No Resparkable MCP code exists** —
  `protocol-handler.ts` already sets `CapabilityContext.userId` from the key's
  creator and every brain capability already refuses to run without one, so
  per-user isolation over MCP is the owner-scope guard phase 6 shipped, reached
  through a different door. Rows only.

  **The manifest is the access control, and the intuitive reading is wrong.**
  `McpApiKey.scopedAgentId` looks like it narrows a key to that agent's bound
  capabilities; `listMcpTools()` scoping is default-allow and drops only
  capabilities with an explicit `isEnabled: false` binding row, while Resparkable's
  bindings work by absence. So every enabled tool is callable by every key.
  Seven reads plus `resparkable_capture` are on the list; everything that creates
  structure — projects, goals, people, links, promotions, reviews, reprioritise
  — is deliberately absent, and `mcp/exposure.test.ts` asserts each one's
  absence individually so a new write capability has to be considered rather
  than inherited.

  Also: `resparkable_triage_accuracy`, a deterministic grader
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/evaluations/triage-accuracy.ts`) scoring
  `0.5 × decision + 0.5 × F1 over the link set`, and thirty hand-classified
  captured thoughts to run it against — seeded as an `AiDataset` and runnable
  with `npm run framework:resparkable:eval-triage`. It is a script rather than a
  batch run for two reasons: core has no seam for registering a fork's grader
  where the route-realm worker would see it (Resparkable ask #33), and the subject
  writes — `resparkable-triage` is bound to tools that create tasks, and a batch run
  executes it as whoever queued it, so the script runs the cases as a throwaway
  user it deletes afterwards.

  MCP **resources** (`resparkable://today` and friends) are deferred, not worked
  around: `resource-registry.ts` dispatches through a module-local handler map a
  fork cannot extend (Resparkable ask #32). Every read path is exposed as a tool and
  works; the cost is one tool call where a resource read would have been free.

- **Resparkable answers a subject-access request** (GDPR Art. 15).
  `collectResparkableSubjectData(scope)` (`repo/subject-export.ts`) returns all
  seventeen owner-scoped brain tables — thoughts, tasks, projects, goals, areas,
  people, documents and their extracted text, links, boards, tags, checklists,
  time blocks, reviews and the activity log — wired into the platform bundle
  through `lib/app/data-export.ts`, which Resparkable 0.8.0 added as the fork seam
  ([resparkable#467](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/467)).
  Resparkable had Art. 17 covered since phase 1 (every table cascades from
  `ResparkableSpace`); this is the half that had no seam to fill until now.

  `ResparkableSpace.inboxToken` is omitted — a live bearer secret, and core's rule is
  to withhold credential material even from its owner, because an export bundle
  is a file that gets emailed and synced. `ResparkableEmbedding` is excluded with a
  written reason: derived vectors over text already exported in full, which is
  the same ground on which core excludes `AiMessageEmbedding`. Every fetch uses
  Prisma's `omit` rather than `select`, so a column added tomorrow is exported by
  default; a completeness guard reads `framework-resparkable.prisma` directly and
  fails the build if a table holding a `userId` is in neither the manifest nor
  the exclusion list. Left unwritten, that gap has no symptom — the bundle looks
  complete and quietly answers less than it claims.

- **Resparkable phase 8 — the lifecycle.** `enforceResparkableRetention(scope)` enforces seven
  of the eight `ResparkableSpace.retentionPolicy` windows that phase 1 shipped and nothing
  had applied — `staleEntityDays` is the exception and stays unread, because §11 says a
  person or company is never auto-archived and the settings card no longer offers it —
  running on the connection sweep's per-brain rotation
  (`registerResparkableJobs()`). New `GET /api/v1/resparkable/stale` and
  `POST /api/v1/resparkable/stale/still-live`, an eighteenth capability
  (`resparkable_get_stale_digest`, read-only), a `stale_digest` step on
  `resparkable-horizon-check`, the retention windows in `/resparkable/settings`, and a new
  `/resparkable/archive` surface holding both the digest and the archived-item lists.
  `includeArchived` gains a third value, `only`, which is what makes an archive view
  an archive rather than a longer list. No migration — every column this needed has
  existed since the first one.

  **The rule the design turns on: nothing a human wrote is ever deleted by a clock.**
  Notes, tasks, projects, goals and reviews auto-*archive* and stay restorable for
  ever; only derived and log data is deleted. Archiving drops the entity's vectors in
  the same transaction as the stamp, so recall does not degrade as history grows, and
  every rule caps at 500 rows per pass and reports `capped` — a run that stopped at
  its limit is otherwise indistinguishable from one that found everything.

  One departure from the plan: `plan.md` §11 put retention in the nightly workflow and
  `install.md` §2.10 put it on the app jobs. The job is right, and §11 has been
  corrected — nothing about retention is a moment, so per-user cron rows would buy
  nothing and cost a row each to create, correct after a DST change and delete on
  erasure.

- **Resparkable phase 7 — the background.** Four scheduled workflows
  (`resparkable-nightly-triage`, `resparkable-morning-briefing`, `resparkable-weekly-review`,
  `resparkable-horizon-check`) on per-user `AiWorkflowSchedule` rows created by
  `ensureResparkableSchedules()`, plus the connection sweep on `registerAppJob`. Three
  new capabilities (`resparkable_get_briefing`, `resparkable_get_briefing_inputs`,
  `resparkable_notify`), a sixth agent (`resparkable-briefer`), `GET /api/v1/resparkable/briefing`
  and `POST /api/v1/resparkable/briefing/regenerate`. `GET /api/v1/resparkable/today` gains a
  `briefing` object. New migration `20260804150000_resparkable_space_sweep_cursor`
  (`ResparkableSpace.lastSweptAt`).

  Two departures from the plan, both because the step type did not do what was
  assumed: the briefing's factual half is rendered by a service rather than a
  `report` step (which renders the *execution trace*, not domain facts), and
  `workStyle` selection happens in code rather than via a `route` step (which is an
  LLM classifier, so it would spend a model call guessing a column we can read).

- **Resparkable: the way in** (phase 6c) — the per-turn context block, the app-owned
  chat route, and the page. This is what turns fourteen capabilities into
  something you can talk to. Registered through the fork-owned
  `lib/app/context-contributors.ts` scaffold; no Resparkable-owned source file is
  touched. Rules and reasoning: `.context/framework/resparkable/agents.md` §§10–12.
  - **The `resparkable` context block**, injected into every turn: today's date,
    weekday, ISO week and timezone; goals ordered longest-horizon-first with
    target dates as distances ("in 4d", "overdue by 2d") so the model never has
    to subtract; active projects with days since activity; the top five tasks
    with the scorer's own dominant factor; inbox, open tasks, unreviewed
    connections, remaining weekly capacity; and area balance — **only for areas
    that carry a weekly target**, since one without a target does not participate
    in balancing at all and reporting it as attended would be a lie the agent
    repeats back.
  - **The loader reads `request.userId` and ignores the `id` argument.**
    `buildContext` caches on `type:id:userId`, so a loader that trusted `id`
    would render one person's goals into another person's prompt and then serve
    the cached answer for the rest of the TTL. An absent `userId` yields `''`,
    never a fallback.
  - **Bounded twice.** Per-section row caps stop a four-hundred-project corpus
    becoming four hundred lines, and a ~1200-token character budget catches what
    they cannot — truncating on whole lines, because half an id in a prompt is
    worse than no id: the model will try to use it. A capped section says so, so
    the agent searches rather than assuming it has seen everything.
  - **Invalidation lives in `recordResparkableEvent`**, before the write and
    regardless of whether it succeeds. Every mutation in the tier records an
    event, so no service can forget — including ones written later.
    `reprioritiseTasks` invalidates directly: it is the one mutation that records
    no event, and precisely the one that reorders the block's task list.
  - **`POST /api/v1/resparkable/chat/stream`** — `withAuth`, `streamChat` directly,
    `sseResponse`. Its own route because the consumer route deliberately drops
    `contextType` / `contextId` and the admin route requires `withAdminAuth`.
    Both context fields are pinned server-side (`contextId` is the session user,
    and the request schema has no such key, so an attempt is a 400 rather than a
    silently ignored field), and `agentSlug` is checked against
    `RESPARKABLE_CHAT_AGENT_SLUGS`. That check is the only thing between a browser
    and `resparkable-triage`: `streamChat` does not gate on `AiAgent.visibility`,
    which is what lets the companion stay `internal`. An unknown slug and a
    restricted one get an identical response.
  - New rate-limit tier **`resparkable-chat`** (20/min, session-user). Per-minute
    rather than per-hour because chat is genuinely conversational; the per-turn
    spend ceiling is separate and lives on the agent row.
  - **`/resparkable/chat`**, on Resparkable's own chat component rather than Sunrise's
    `<ChatInterface>` — that one posts to a hardcoded admin endpoint with no prop
    for it (ask #26). It reuses the platform's `parseChatStreamEvent` and
    `getUserFacingError` (the wire contract and the error map, both genuinely
    shared) and rebuilds only the rendering, dropping the admin-only cost, token
    and tool-argument-trace surfaces. It adds a chip naming **which tools ran**,
    in plain terms — an agent that quietly created three tasks while answering a
    question is the thing people stop trusting.
  - New named exports: `registerResparkableContextContributor`,
    `invalidateResparkableContext`, `RESPARKABLE_CONTEXT_TYPE`
    (`lib/framework/resparkable/context`), `loadResparkableContext`,
    `renderResparkableContext` (`…/context/contributor.ts`),
    `resparkableChatRequestSchema`, `RESPARKABLE_API.CHAT_STREAM`,
    `RESPARKABLE_ROUTES.CHAT`, and `<ResparkableChat>`.

- **Resparkable: the agent layer** (phase 6b) — fourteen capabilities, five agents,
  the shared `resparkable-core` profile, and the four seeds that make them reachable.
  Registered through the fork-owned `lib/app/capabilities.ts` scaffold, so no
  Resparkable-owned file is touched. Full rules and reasoning:
  `.context/framework/resparkable/agents.md`.
  - **Fourteen capabilities** — `resparkable_capture`, `resparkable_search`,
    `resparkable_list_tasks`, `resparkable_promote_thought`, `resparkable_upsert_task` /
    `_project` / `_goal` / `_entity`, `resparkable_link_entities`,
    `resparkable_find_connections`, `resparkable_get_snapshot`, `resparkable_write_review`,
    `resparkable_reprioritise`, `resparkable_ideate`. Each calls the same service the
    matching HTTP route does, so an agent-created task carries the same events,
    `completedAt` stamping and project-momentum bump as one created in the UI.
  - **`resparkable_promote_thought` is a deliberate addition to `plan.md` §5's
    thirteen.** None of the thirteen could mark a thought as processed, so a
    nightly triage run created tasks and left every note sitting in the inbox
    looking untouched — then processed the same notes again the next night. It
    wraps the existing `promoteThought` service, which is what records
    `promotedToType` / `promotedToId`, links the thought to what it became, and
    emits the `promoted` event the weekly review counts. **Dropping a thought is
    still not possible from any agent**: promotion is additive and visible,
    marking someone's note as rubbish unattended is neither.
  - **The owner is resolved before a capability body runs.** `ResparkableCapability`
    mints the `OwnerScope` from `CapabilityContext.userId` — set by the platform
    from the session, the schedule's `createdBy`, or the MCP key's owner, none of
    them reachable from a model — and hands it to `run()`. A subclass cannot
    express an unscoped read, which matters more than the check itself: the
    failure it prevents is a fourteenth capability that never had one.
  - **The model cannot influence the ranking.** All three `manualBoost*` fields
    are `omit()`ed from every upsert schema, so writing one is a type error
    rather than a review note, and `resparkable_reprioritise` accepts **no arguments
    at all** — not a weight, not a filter, not an id. It triggers the
    deterministic scorer; it cannot steer it.
  - **Provenance is pinned server-side.** `resparkable_capture` sets
    `source: 'agent'` rather than accepting one, and `resparkable_link_entities`
    cannot choose `origin` or `status`. Provenance the caller chooses is not
    provenance — and a link the model invented would move tasks up the user's
    ranking, since the scorer's goal-alignment walk follows accepted links.
  - **Every capability redacts its own audit row.** `AiMessage.provenance` sits
    outside the Resparkable erasure cascade, so the thirteen overrides keep structure
    (ids, `type:id` refs, statuses, horizons, counts) and mask prose (titles,
    note bodies, search queries, and a third party's name **and** website). An id
    resolves to nothing once the row is erased; a title would survive in the
    audit bundle for ever. `resparkable_get_snapshot` keeps nothing at all.
  - **Reads carry `output.sources`**, which the engine lifts onto the workflow
    trace so the approval and trace UI can render "because of these four notes"
    as typed pills rather than free text. Confidence tracks the retrieval score
    instead of being asserted flat.
  - **Five agents** — `resparkable-companion` (0.4), `resparkable-triage` (0.1),
    `resparkable-connector` (0.6, the one tuned for divergence), `resparkable-strategist`
    (0.3) and `resparkable-judge` (`kind: 'judge'`, 0.0, the target of the horizon
    check's `judge_call`). All inherit the `resparkable-core` `AiAgentProfile` with
    `guardrailsMode: 'append'`, all are `knowledgeAccessMode: 'restricted'` (the
    global KB is not the user's notes), and all three guard modes are set
    explicitly rather than inheriting a deployment default.
  - **Bindings are the enforcement, not the prompts.** The connector cannot write
    a link, triage cannot create a project, goal or person, the strategist writes
    only reviews, and `resparkable-judge` is bound to nothing — zero rows means zero
    advertised tools. Revocation is `isEnabled: false`, never deleting the row: a
    missing pivot row synthesizes a default-ALLOW binding in the dispatcher.
  - `001-capabilities` and `004-agent-capabilities` declare `hashInputs` over
    `capabilities/catalogue.ts`. The seed runner hashes a unit's own source to
    decide whether to re-run it, and those two files barely change — so without
    it, upgrading Resparkable delivers a new tool's code and no row for it, and the
    dispatcher refuses it at `capability_inactive`.
  - New seeds `prisma/seeds/framework-resparkable/001-capabilities`,
    `002-agent-profile`, `003-agents`, `004-agent-capabilities`. Capability rows
    are written **from the code catalogue**, so a row cannot drift from its
    handler; re-seeding rewrites prompts and function definitions (code
    artefacts) and leaves `isActive`, `rateLimit`, `requiresApproval`,
    `quarantineState`, `model`, `provider`, `temperature`, `maxTokens` and
    `AiAgentCapability.isEnabled` untouched.
  - New named exports: `registerResparkableCapabilities`,
    `resparkableCapabilityHandlers` (`lib/framework/resparkable/capabilities`),
    `RESPARKABLE_CAPABILITIES`, `RESPARKABLE_CAPABILITY_SLUGS`,
    `RESPARKABLE_CAPABILITY_CATEGORY`, `resparkableCapabilitySpec`
    (`…/capabilities/catalogue.ts`), `ResparkableCapability`, `requireResparkableUser`,
    `MissingResparkableUserError`, `maskFreeText`, `brainSources`
    (`…/capabilities/base.ts`), `findNeighbours` / `hydrateNeighbours`
    (`…/services/neighbours.ts` — extracted from `services/ideate.ts` so the
    ideation path and `resparkable_find_connections` agree on what an empty result
    means), and the `agent*Schema` argument schemas in
    `lib/framework/resparkable/validations.ts`.

- **Resparkable: the write paths the agent layer needs** (phase 6a) — four services
  and their HTTP routes, added ahead of the capabilities that call them so that
  every capability has an API-accessible twin rather than a private one. Each
  service is the single implementation the web UI, the agent layer and MCP all
  go through, which is what stops agent writes and UI writes diverging.
  - `POST /api/v1/resparkable/capture` — the idempotent front door. Deduping on
    `externalId` means a redelivered webhook, a retried phone request and a
    double-tapped Shortcut return the original row (`200`) instead of creating a
    second inbox item (`201` for a genuine create). A deduped capture records no
    second `captured` event, so the weekly review's "what you finished" count
    stays honest.
  - `GET /api/v1/resparkable/snapshot` — the whole brain in an LLM-shaped payload:
    goals, active projects, top tasks, area balance and capacity, at a fixed
    eight queries however many rows exist. Every section reports `truncated`
    when it stopped at its cap, because a section that silently stopped looks
    exactly like one that found everything. ETag'd.
  - `POST /api/v1/resparkable/ideate` — framings on demand, over a **wider**
    similarity floor than the nightly sweep uses, because the interesting
    framings come from the nearly-unrelated pairs. Read-only; the only thing it
    persists is an `AiCostLog` row. Ids the model invents are stripped from each
    framing's `drawsOn`, since a hallucinated id is worse than no id — it looks
    like provenance.
  - `GET`/`POST /api/v1/resparkable/reviews` and `GET /api/v1/resparkable/reviews/[id]` —
    the write path for generated artefacts. Append-only by design: regenerating
    writes a new row, because "what did the strategist say three weeks ago" is
    the question the table exists to answer.
  - New rate-limit tier **`resparkable-ideate`** (10/hour, session-user), tighter
    than the tier's other sub-caps because it is the only flow that buys tokens
    per request.
  - New named exports: `RESPARKABLE_AGENT_SLUGS`, `RESPARKABLE_PROFILE_SLUG`,
    `RESPARKABLE_CHAT_AGENT_SLUGS` (`lib/framework/resparkable/agents.ts`), and
    `RESPARKABLE_API.CAPTURE` / `.SNAPSHOT` / `.IDEATE` / `.REVIEWS` / `.reviewById`.

- **`RESPARKABLE_NAV_ITEM`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/protected-nav.ts`) — Resparkable's
  header link, offered as a value rather than a registrar because the protected
  nav is a `null`-or-array *override*, not a registry: a framework tier can only
  offer an item the host places where it wants. The host spreads it in
  `lib/app/protected-nav.ts`. This replaces the hand-edit of
  `components/layouts/protected-nav.tsx` that Resparkable carried since phase 5, so
  **Resparkable now touches zero Sunrise-owned files.**


- **Resparkable phase 5 — the UI layer** (Release 1, phases 5 and 5b): twelve
  authenticated surfaces under `app/(protected)/resparkable/**` — Today, Inbox,
  Search, Projects, Goals, Areas, People, Documents, Connections, Graph, Boards
  and Plan — plus personal Settings. Components live in `components/resparkable/**`
  and page paths in the new `RESPARKABLE_ROUTES` (`lib/framework/resparkable/ui/routes.ts`).
- **Resparkable: new API endpoints backing those surfaces** — `GET /api/v1/resparkable/counts`,
  `/connections`, `/graph`; `POST /api/v1/resparkable/thoughts/[id]/promote`; enriched
  reads at `/projects/[id]/view`, `/entities/[id]/view`, `/tasks/[id]/view`; and the
  boards layer: `/boards` (+ `[id]`, `/view`, `/cards`, `/cards/[cardId]`, `/export`,
  `/restore`), `/tags` (+ `[id]`), `PATCH /tasks/[id]/tags`,
  `/tasks/[id]/checklist` and `/checklist/[id]`.
- **Resparkable: `ResparkableSpace.connectionStrengthFloor`** (migration
  `20260730160000_resparkable_connection_floor`) — the similarity a pair must clear to be
  proposed as a connection, per user. Nullable; `null` uses the measured 0.55 default.
  The right value is model-dependent, and a mis-tuned floor produces exactly the same
  output as a sweep with nothing left to find. Exposed on `GET`/`PATCH /resparkable/space`.
- **Resparkable: `listLinksForEntity` / `listLinksForEntities`** on the links repo, and
  `statuses` on `LinkFilters` — a detail page needs links on *either* end of a
  polymorphic edge, and the review queue filters by two statuses at once.
- **Resparkable: task status changes now record `{ statusFrom, statusTo }`** on their
  `updated` event, and `findLatestStatusChanges` reads the newest per task in one
  `DISTINCT ON`. This is what lets a board say how long a card has sat in its column
  (§12) without giving up its fixed query count; cards with no such event fall back to
  "untouched since", worded differently so the two are never confused.
- **Resparkable: `findTasksByIds`** on the tasks repo — the explicit-board read needs
  exactly its pinned tasks rather than the top N by score.
- **Resparkable: `renumberChecklistItems`** on the checklist repo — the counterpart to
  `renumberBoardCards`. `planMove` computes a moved item's position against the
  *spread* list once a gap has collapsed, so the spread has to be written in the
  same pass or the item lands at a coordinate its siblings never moved to.

- **Resparkable framework-tier scaffold** (Release 1, phase 0) — the reserved
  `/framework` tier is now occupied by Resparkable: `lib/framework/resparkable/` with
  `initResparkable()` and `resparkableEnvSchema`, the tier import boundary in
  `lib/framework/eslint.config.mjs` (including the D5 owner/shared repo rule),
  an empty `prisma/schema/framework-resparkable.prisma`, and
  `.context/framework/resparkable/install.md`. Wired through four Sunrise seams —
  `bootstrap.ts` (dynamic import), `env.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
  `protected-routes.ts` (`/resparkable`) — with **zero Sunrise-owned files
  modified**.
- **`lib/app/leaf-bootstrap.ts`** — new boot seam Resparkable re-exposes to the leaf
  forks built on it, so a leaf fork and Resparkable don't contend over
  `lib/app/bootstrap.ts`. Ships empty; called by `initResparkable()` after Resparkable's
  own registrations, so a leaf fork can override them.
- **Resparkable data model** (Release 1, phase 1) — 18 `framework_resparkable_*` models
  in `prisma/schema/framework-resparkable.prisma` and the hand-edited migration
  `20260728222816_add_second_brain`. One satellite table (`ResparkableSpace`) with a
  hand-written `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK to `user`, one polymorphic edge table and
  one polymorphic `vector(1536)` embedding table, so the whole brain cascades on
  erasure and there is a single HNSW index to maintain.
- **`registerResparkableDriftProbes()`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/db-drift.ts`) — six
  probes over the Postgres objects Prisma cannot model, registered from
  `lib/app/db-drift.ts`. The two `GENERATED` probes assert `is_generated`, not
  just column existence, so a column silently recreated as a plain `tsvector`
  fails the check instead of never being populated.
- **`ensureResparkableSpace()`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/services/space.ts`) —
  idempotent, race-safe first-use creation of a user's space, plus
  `getResparkableSpace()` and `findSpaceByInboxToken()`.
- **Resparkable repo layer and CRUD API** (Release 1, phase 2) —
  `lib/framework/resparkable/repo/*` with the branded `OwnerScope` type, seven
  entity repos, `lib/framework/resparkable/services/*` (resource descriptors, slug
  resolution, activity events) and 20 route files under
  `app/api/v1/resparkable/**` covering tasks, projects, goals, areas, thoughts,
  entities and time blocks. `DELETE` archives; `?permanent=true` destroys.
- **`scripts/framework/resparkable/smoke-isolation.ts`**
  (`npm run framework:resparkable:smoke-isolation`) — proves cross-user isolation
  and the erasure cascade against a real database. Namespaced and kept out of
  `scripts/smoke/` because `CUSTOMIZATION.md` §7 reserves the unprefixed script
  names, `smoke:*` included, for the platform.
- **Resparkable priority engine** (Release 1, phase 3) —
  `lib/framework/resparkable/priority/score.ts` is a pure, I/O-free function over
  six weighted factors (urgency, goal alignment, project momentum, area balance,
  effort fit, staleness) plus an additive `manualBoost`, so `+1` provably
  outranks every unboosted task and `-1` provably sinks below them. An expired
  boost reads as `0` at evaluation time rather than being lazily zeroed, so
  behaviour never depends on whether a background job has run.
  `priority/reprioritise.ts` gathers the inputs in a fixed number of batched
  queries and persists `priorityScore` + `priorityFactors`; `rescoreTask()`
  narrows that to one row and runs on every task mutation, so a pin takes effect
  immediately instead of at 3am.
- **Resparkable snooze** (`lib/framework/resparkable/services/snooze.ts`) — `snoozeItem`
  / `unsnoozeItem` over tasks, thoughts and projects, with presets
  (`later_today`, `tomorrow`, `next_week`, `next_month`) resolved server-side in
  `ResparkableSpace.timezone` rather than by the caller. `snoozeCount` counts the
  gesture and is never decremented, and is never an input to the scorer. Exposed
  as `POST /api/v1/resparkable/{tasks,thoughts,projects}/[id]/snooze` and
  `.../unsnooze`.
- **`lib/framework/resparkable/time/zoned.ts`** — wall-clock arithmetic in the
  user's zone (`wallClockAt`, `instantAtWallClock`, `startOfZonedDay`,
  `startOfZonedWeek`, `addZonedDays`, `addZonedMonths`, `timeOfDayAt`), built on
  `Intl` with no new dependency. Days are 23 or 25 hours long twice a year, and
  every scheduling phrase in Resparkable resolves through here rather than through
  server time.
- **`GET /api/v1/resparkable/today`** — the dashboard's only fetch: ranked tasks
  enriched with project and area, today's time blocks, inbox count, goals at
  risk, unreviewed connections, the latest review and this week's remaining
  capacity, in a fixed number of queries regardless of task count. ETag'd.
- **`GET /api/v1/resparkable/inbox`** — captured thoughts with their suggested links
  and the strongest suggested project, resolved in two batched queries. ETag'd.
- **`GET` / `PATCH /api/v1/resparkable/space`** — the caller's effective settings
  with defaults resolved, plus `customised` flags. `inboxToken` is deliberately
  never included. Backed by Zod schemas for the three previously unvalidated
  `Json` columns (`priorityWeightsSchema` — which requires the weights to sum to
  1 — `energyProfileSchema`, `retentionPolicySchema`) and by
  `lib/framework/resparkable/settings.ts`, whose resolvers safe-parse those columns
  and fall back to documented defaults rather than letting a malformed blob
  write `NaN` into every score.

- **`scripts/framework/resparkable/smoke-priority.ts`**
  (`npm run framework:resparkable:smoke-priority`) — exercises the ranking, snooze
  and aggregate paths against a real database: the space bootstrap, the batched
  score write, `sumMinutesByArea`'s raw SQL, a real indexed
  `ORDER BY priorityScore`, preset resolution in `Pacific/Auckland`, and that
  none of the new surfaces leak across users.
- **Resparkable semantic layer** (Release 1, phase 4) — the brain is now searchable
  by meaning. `searchResparkable()`
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/search/hybrid-search.ts`) is the **only** search entry
  point and takes an `OwnerScope` as a required field, so a route param or an LLM
  tool argument cannot become one. It runs three passes: vector + BM25 over the
  one embedding table, the generated tsvector for tasks (which are deliberately
  not embedded), and — only when `includeArchived` is set — a keyword pass over
  the archived corpus, which by design has no vectors at all.
- **All Resparkable vector SQL lives in `lib/framework/resparkable/repo/embeddings.ts`.**
  The plan put it in `search/`, but the tier lint boundary forbids Prisma outside
  `repo/**` — which is the stronger arrangement, because the raw SQL is the one
  place a `WHERE "userId"` can be forgotten and this confines it to the layer
  whose every function carries a verified scope. Includes
  `assertResparkableModelMatchesStoredVectors()`, a port of the platform's private
  dimension guard (upstream
  [#491](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/491) asks
  for a shared version).
- **Resparkable indexer** (`lib/framework/resparkable/embedding/{canonical,indexer}.ts`)
  — `canonicalText()` and `contentHash()` are pure and cover **semantic content
  only**, never rendered markdown, so formatting noise (CRLF, trailing
  whitespace, a `null` → `''` description) is not an edit. `indexedHash` is nulled
  liberally by every mutation path because nulling it queues a *hash comparison*,
  not an embedding call: `reindexPending()` compares the recomputed hash against
  what is stored and only then spends anything. That is what lets a mutation path
  null the column without knowing which fields are semantic.
- **Resparkable connection engine** (`lib/framework/resparkable/search/connections.ts`) —
  `findConnections()` is read-only and idempotent; `sweepConnections()` persists
  pairs above a 0.72 similarity floor as
  `ResparkableLink{ origin: 'rule', status: 'suggested' }`. Both read
  **already-stored** vectors and do neighbour search in SQL, so the sweep costs
  no embedding tokens. Pair exclusion — including the `rejected` tombstone, in
  both directions — happens inside the query, so no caller can forget it.
- **Resparkable document ingestion**
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/documents/{ingest,chunking}.ts`) — reuses the
  platform's `parseDocument()` (PDF, DOCX, EPUB, CSV, HTML, MD, TXT) and its
  markdown and semantic chunkers, but stores rows in Resparkable's own tables:
  `.context/orchestration/knowledge.md` is explicit that the platform KB is a
  global asset and per-user scoping there is an anti-pattern. Dedupes on
  `fileHash` scoped to the owner, and queues indexing rather than embedding
  inline.
- **`ResparkableSettings`** — an instance-settings singleton and the one Resparkable
  table with no `userId`, so also the one outside the D1 erasure cascade. Holds
  `documentOriginals` (`discard | retain`) and `maxDocumentBytes`, exposed at
  `GET|PATCH /api/v1/admin/resparkable/settings` and `/admin/resparkable/settings`.
- **New Resparkable routes** — `GET /resparkable/search`, `POST /resparkable/reindex`,
  `GET|POST /resparkable/links`, `PATCH /resparkable/links/[id]`,
  `POST /resparkable/connections/sweep`, `GET|POST /resparkable/documents`,
  `GET|DELETE /resparkable/documents/[id]`,
  `GET /resparkable/documents/[id]/download`. There is deliberately no
  `DELETE /resparkable/links/[id]`: rejecting sets `status: 'rejected'`, which is the
  tombstone that stops the sweep re-proposing a dismissed pair forever.
- **`registerResparkableRateLimits()`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts`) —
  per-flow sub-caps for the four expensive paths (search 30/min; reindex and
  sweep 5/hour; document upload 20/hour), keyed on the session user. Wired
  through the `lib/app/rate-limit.ts` seam with one call, so a later Resparkable
  release can add one without every host editing that file.
- **`registerResparkableAdminNav()`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/admin-nav.ts`) — the
  Resparkable admin section, wired through `lib/app/admin-nav.ts`. Client-safe by
  necessity: the sidebar reads the registry during render.
- **`lib/framework/resparkable/api/endpoints.ts`** — Resparkable's own endpoint
  constants. `lib/api/endpoints.ts` is Sunrise-owned, so adding Resparkable's routes
  there would be a merge conflict inflicted on every host on every upgrade.
- **`scripts/framework/resparkable/smoke-search.ts`**
  (`npm run framework:resparkable:smoke-search`) — 26 assertions against a real
  database over the pgvector SQL, the HNSW index, tsvector ranking, cross-user
  isolation (**including the case where another user's row is the better vector
  match**), the sweep, the tombstone, and the archive transaction. Runs with real
  embeddings when a provider is configured and with deterministic synthetic
  vectors when not, printing which — so a green run never claims more than it
  proved.

### Security

- **Live credentials are now dropped from transfer bundles, not merely left
  unwritten.** `ResparkableSpace.inboxToken`,
  `AiWorkflowTrigger.signingSecret`, `AiEventHook.secret` and
  `AiWebhookSubscription.secret` moved from `regenerate` to `redact`. The two
  fields answer different questions — `regenerate` stops a value being written
  on the way *in*, while a secret's problem is on the way *out*: these still
  authenticate traffic against the installation the bundle came **from**, and a
  bundle is a file that gets emailed, synced and forgotten. This is the call
  `repo/subject-export.ts` already made when it omitted `inboxToken` from the
  Art. 15 export "even though the subject owns it". The coverage guard no longer
  accepts `regenerate` as an answer for a secret-shaped column, and a second
  assertion fails any policy that tries. No release has shipped an export route,
  so no bundle containing these values was ever produced.

- **Resparkable schedules are deleted when their owner is erased.**
  `AiWorkflowSchedule.createdBy` is `onDelete: SetNull`, so per-user schedules would
  otherwise outlive the account — enabled, with a live `nextRunAt`, firing for ever
  against a deleted user. Resparkable now registers an erasure cleanup hook, and because
  `eraseUser()` reads a plain module-scope registry without lazily initialising any
  `lib/app/*` seam (the resparkable#462 module-split shape, for a registry that fix did
  not cover), the connection-sweep job independently deletes Resparkable schedules whose
  `createdBy` is null. Relatedly, `inputTemplate` is stored empty: it carries no
  email address — the address is resolved at send time from the row erasure deletes
  — and no `userId` either, because the template becomes the execution's `inputData`
  and a step declaring no `args` receives it, which a `.strict()` capability schema
  rejects. The owner travels on `execution.userId`, stamped from `createdBy`.

- **`resparkable_notify` cannot be made to send arbitrary mail.** It takes a
  closed-set notification name and an optional integer — no recipient, no subject,
  no body — and every word a recipient reads is rendered server-side. A free-text
  notifier bound to an agent would be an exfiltration channel for the brain and a
  phishing primitive sent from the product's own address.

- **Rejected connection suggestions are never pruned by retention.** The connection
  sweep excludes any pair that already has an `ResparkableLink` row, so a `rejected` row
  is the tombstone that stops a suggestion the user turned down being proposed again
  every week for ever. `pruneStaleSuggestedLinks` matches `status: 'suggested'`
  positively rather than excluding `'rejected'`, because the negative form is one
  careless edit from deleting the tombstones — and the damage surfaces weeks later, as
  a nag loop with no way for the user to make it stop.

- **`isRootRelativePath()` / `safeCallbackUrl()` no longer pass a tab, LF or CR
  hidden inside a redirect path.** The guard judged `path[1]` on the raw string,
  but the WHATWG URL parser removes those three characters from _anywhere_ in a
  URL before it reads the authority, and `trim()` only reaches the ends — so
  `/<TAB>/evil.com` cleared both the leading-slash and the `path[1]` test, then
  collapsed to `//evil.com` in the browser. Reachable as
  `/login?callbackUrl=/%09/evil.com`, which hard-navigates a user off-origin
  immediately after a genuine successful login. The strip is deliberately
  tab/LF/CR only and not the wider `URL_NORMALIZE_STRIP` used for scheme
  inspection, because that range includes the space and would rewrite a
  legitimate `/search?q=two words`; `safeCallbackUrl()` now returns the
  normalised value, so the string that reaches `router.push()` is the one that
  was judged safe. The OAuth path was never affected — better-auth applies its
  own stricter allowlist. Carried as a local patch to a Resparkable-owned file
  pending [resparkable#506](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/506).

- **`Cache-Control: private, no-cache` on Resparkable's per-user read endpoints**
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/api/cache.ts`, applied by `/resparkable/today`,
  `/resparkable/inbox` and `/resparkable/space`). Sunrise sets no cache directive on
  `/api/v1/**`, and a response carrying an `ETag` with no freshness information
  is heuristically cacheable (RFC 9111 §4.2.2) — so a shared proxy could store
  one person's dashboard and serve it to the next caller. `no-cache` rather than
  `no-store`, so the browser may still keep a copy and revalidate, which is what
  the ETag exists for. The 304 carries the directive too. A project-wide default
  is upstream
  [#487](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/487).
- **Uploaded document originals are discarded by default**
  (`ResparkableSettings.documentOriginals = 'discard'`). Sunrise's `StorageProvider`
  has no read method at all, and `LocalProvider` ignores `public: false` — it
  writes into `public/uploads/`, which Next serves statically at a guessable URL.
  Retaining a user's uploaded PDF on a default install would therefore publish it.
  Resparkable keeps the extracted text and the embedding chunks, which is what the
  product actually queries, and drops the bytes. Retention is an operator setting
  that the admin page **disables** on providers that cannot store privately or
  cannot sign URLs, rather than warning and allowing it; when retained, the stored
  URL is never returned to a client and downloads go through a 5-minute signed
  URL. Upstream
  [#490](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/490).
- **`GET /api/v1/resparkable/search` does not log the query text.** It is the most
  sensitive string a user sends this product, and a log line outlives the search;
  the route logs its length and the hit count instead.

### Changed

- **The Areas nav item and page are relabelled "Life"**, with copy that invites
  saying what's important right now rather than assigning a weekly time
  budget. See the `Removed` entry for `targetWeeklyMinutes` below. No route,
  API, or model name changed; this is the user-facing label and copy only.
- **The priority-scoring formula is reweighted to five factors.**
  `base = 0.35·urgency + 0.30·goalAlignment + 0.18·projectMomentum + 0.12·effortFit + 0.05·staleness`,
  proportionally redistributing the removed `areaBalance` factor's 0.15
  across the rest. `PRIORITY_FACTORS`, `priorityWeightsSchema`, and
  `priorityFactorsSchema` all drop the `areaBalance` key.
- **`exportAccount()` returns a format-neutral result.** `AccountExport` drops
  `manifest` — which only the JSON bundle has — and gains `contentType`,
  `format` and `totalRows`. The route reads `totalRows` for its
  `X-Transfer-Rows` header and `contentType` for the response, so a format that
  is not a zip is sent as itself. `exportAccount()` also takes an optional
  `format`.

- **`lib/portability/bundle.ts` exports its manifest and README builders.**
  `buildBundleManifest()`, `renderBundleReadme()`, `jsonDataPath`, the
  `DataPathFor` type and `isoDate()` are now public so the CSV rendering shares
  them rather than writing a second copy of the four omission lists — redacted
  columns, reissued columns, unreachable tables, excluded tables. A second copy
  would drift, and it would drift silently: both manifests would still look
  complete. `buildTransferBundle()` is unchanged.

- **BREAKING — the project is renamed Obsiddy → Resparkable, and the fork's own
  brand name goes with it.** Every public identifier moves: the 19 Prisma models
  (`ObsiddySpace` → `ResparkableSpace`, and so on), the 19 tables they map to
  (`framework_obsiddy_*` → `framework_resparkable_*`), every route under
  `/obsiddy/**` and `/api/v1/obsiddy/**`, the `OBSIDDY_*` constants, the tier
  directories (`lib/framework/obsiddy/`, `prisma/schema/framework-obsiddy.prisma`,
  `.context/framework/obsiddy/`), the four `framework:obsiddy:*` npm scripts, and
  the package name. The GitHub repository is renamed too; GitHub redirects the old
  URL, but remotes should be repointed.

  **The rename also covers `Sunrise` where it named this codebase's brand.** The
  starter template writes its own name into 561 fork-owned files and offers no
  seam for a fork to rebrand, so a fork that wants its own name has to rewrite
  them. **`Sunrise` survives only where it names the upstream project rather than
  this one**: the ~90 links to upstream issues, the `gh issue list --repo
  human-centric-engineering/sunrise` commands, `sunrise-asks.md` (a register of
  asks against a repo that is still called sunrise), and the prose that
  distinguishes a Sunrise-owned file from this tier. Collapsing those would have
  produced "every edit to a Resparkable-owned file is a merge conflict" inside
  Resparkable, and pointed two `gh` commands at the wrong repository.

  **Migrations were rewritten in place rather than fronted with a rename
  migration**, so this requires a database reset; there is no upgrade path from an
  Obsiddy database. Inherited template links that pointed at the upstream repo —
  the landing-page CTAs, the issue-template links, `package.json`'s `bugs` and
  `homepage` — now point at this one.

- **Resparkable has a visual identity: "amber phosphor on volcanic glass"** — and its
  daylight face, the same glass held to the sun. The app ran on stock Resparkable
  blue-on-white with no webfonts at all; it now has a designed system,
  documented in
  [`.context/ui/design-language.md`](./.context/ui/design-language.md).

  **Almost all of it is tokens, so almost no component changed.** `app/brand-theme.css`
  — the fork-owned per-surface seam, which shipped empty — now carries the full
  light and dark palettes, the radius scale (roughly halved: 4px where Tailwind
  had 6, because obsidian fractures into edges rather than curves), the
  atmosphere variables, and seven composed classes (`.term-label`, `.term-meta`,
  `.term-rule`, `.obsidian-field`, `.obsidian-chrome`, `.live-edge`,
  `.obsidian-reveal`). Every shadcn/ui primitive already spoke in semantic
  tokens, so re-pointing them re-skinned the app without edits.

  **Three fonts, three jobs**, loaded via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`:
  **Martian Mono** (`font-display` — `h1`/`h2`, wordmark, tracked micro-labels),
  **JetBrains Mono** (`font-mono` — ids, paths, timestamps, counts, code) and
  **Archivo** (`font-sans` — body and note content). The premise is that the
  chrome is an instrument and the content is a page; a whole UI set in monospace
  is the mistake this genre keeps making.

  **New `@theme` keys in `app/globals.css`:** `--font-display` / `--font-sans` /
  `--font-mono`, and four signal colours — `--color-signal`, `--color-info`,
  `--color-warn`, `--color-sheen`. These have to be declared at build time
  because Tailwind reads `@theme` to decide which utilities exist at all. The
  signals are deliberately separate from `--color-primary`: primary is the
  brand's voice and gets re-pointed per surface, the signals are meanings and
  must not move when it does.

  **The accent is ember amber in dark and indigo `#4338ca` in light** — the one
  token whose hue depends on the mode, and a constraint before it is a choice.
  Amber is a light colour: `#f5a524` is 1.9:1 on white, and any warm
  yellow-orange dragged down to AA on paper reads as brown. Indigo-700 is 7.9:1
  on a white card, deep enough to read as an instrument rather than as the
  lavender every AI product reached for. The light neutrals carry a whisper of it
  — greys that disagree with the buttons read as beige (warm under cool) or dirty
  (green under indigo), and re-pointing the primary without moving them is the
  step that gets forgotten.

  **`/admin` runs on teal**, via the existing `data-surface` seam — deltas only
  (`primary`, `ring`, `--obs-bloom`), everything else inherited. The back office
  is where you change things for everybody, and a colour shift is read
  pre-attentively, before any label is. This block was re-pointed twice while the
  consumer accent settled (cyan, then blue), each time because it had drifted
  inside ~25° of it; roughly 60° of separation is the floor, and that rule is now
  written next to the block.

  **The page wash is deliberately faint** — `--obs-bloom` at 0.045 alpha, its
  gradient anchored above the viewport so only the falloff is on screen. On paper
  a tint has nowhere to hide: the alpha that reads as depth on near-black reads
  as a stain on white, and the eye finds the gradient's edge and starts treating
  it as a shape.

  **Readability, which is the half of this that isn't taste:** body text is 16px;
  `muted-foreground` runs at 6.0:1 (light) / 7.6:1 (dark) rather than the ~3.5:1
  "subtle grey" default; and the 168 instances of `text-[10px]`/`text-[9px]`
  across `app/` and `components/` are now `text-[11px]`. Uppercase tracked text
  below 11px is the most common failure of this aesthetic and the codebase had a
  lot of it.

- **Resparkable chat: one panel, paced streaming, and a wait that explains itself.**
  The transcript and composer are now two regions of a single bordered panel
  rather than two boxes with the page showing through the gap. The user's turn
  keeps its bubble; the assistant's loses it in favour of a rule down the left —
  two near-identical greys down a transcript is a weaker signal than shape and
  alignment, and the reply should read as the page rather than as a quote on it.

  **Streaming is now paced.** The stream was always token-by-token, but providers
  send whatever their buffering produces — often a whole clause — so raw
  rendering arrived in slabs. `useTypingAnimation` (already in `lib/hooks/`, and
  platform-level so the framework tier may import it) sits between the deltas and
  the DOM. State holds the whole answer, the hook holds how much may be shown, and
  the renderer prefers the buffer while `streaming || isAnimating`. There is
  deliberately no `flush()` on the happy path: the stream finishing is not the
  same event as the answer finishing being read. Disabled under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

  **New `<ThinkingIndicator>`** (`components/resparkable/chat/`) — dots plus the
  handler's own status string, replacing a static italic "Thinking…" that was
  indistinguishable from a hung page during a ten-second tool call. Duplicated
  from the admin component rather than imported, per the tier rule: contracts are
  imported (`parseChatStreamEvent`), renderings are not.

  **New `<AutoGrowTextarea>`** (`components/resparkable/ui/`) — one row when empty,
  grows to ten, scrolls past that. Measures `scrollHeight` after collapsing to
  `auto` rather than counting newlines, which soft wrap makes wrong. Plus a mic
  button in the composer, reusing `<VoiceCaptureButton>`; dictation lands in the
  box rather than sending, so a transcript with a wrong word in it can be fixed
  before it is asked.

- **Form fields are opaque.** `<Input>`, `<Textarea>` and `<SelectTrigger>`
  carried `bg-transparent`, which was invisible while the page was card-white and
  became a see-through box over a textured background. All three now use
  `bg-card`. Same root cause as the container sweep below.

- **Every bordered container that holds content now has a surface** —
  `bg-card` added to **158 containers across 99 files** in `components/` and
  `app/`. Chips, pills and swatches are deliberately excluded; they sit _on_
  something rather than holding anything.

  This was invisible debt for the life of the codebase, not a regression from the
  new palette. Resparkable's light theme set `--color-background` **and**
  `--color-card` to the same `#ffffff`, so a bordered box that omitted `bg-card`
  rendered identically to one that had it, and nothing ever revealed the
  omission. The moment the page background stopped being card-white and grew a
  grid, all 158 went see-through at once. Two rules came out of it, both now in
  [`design-language.md`](./.context/ui/design-language.md): identical token
  values hide missing tokens, and a textured page background is a correctness
  constraint rather than decoration — it makes a missing surface obvious instead
  of invisible.

- **Machine output is monospaced.** New `.terminal-surface` class switches a
  subtree to JetBrains Mono with the leading monospace needs at reading length
  (`1.7`, because identical glyph widths strip the word shapes that carry the eye
  across a line). Applied to the Resparkable chat transcript and composer, the capture
  `<Textarea>`, and the morning briefing's title and body — everywhere the app is
  talking to you, or you are talking to it.

  **The class goes on the call site, never inside `MarkdownView`**, which renders
  both assistant replies and notes you typed by hand: same renderer, different
  voice, decided by who is speaking. Your own thoughts, project descriptions and
  entity notes stay in the reading font. Streaming chat output now ends in a
  `.terminal-caret` in place of an italic "Thinking…". The admin orchestration
  chat already had its own `font-mono` treatment and is left alone — it is
  Resparkable-owned. Rules in
  [`.context/framework/resparkable/ui.md` §12](./.context/framework/resparkable/ui.md).

- **`<BrandMark>` renders a shard mark and wordmark, and takes `className`.**
  The fork-owned brand slot returned a bare string; it now returns an inline SVG
  (`currentColor`, so it follows the `/admin` colour shift with no variant logic)
  beside the name in the display font. `BRAND.name` is still the only text node,
  so the surrounding link's accessible name is unchanged and the SVG is
  `aria-hidden`. This is the modification the seam exists to absorb —
  `brand-mark.test.tsx` was updated to hold the seam's contract (name reaches the
  DOM as text, decoration stays decoration) rather than the default body's.

- **`<AppHeader>` is sticky glass.** `.obsidian-chrome` (blur + saturation boost
  + a 1px inset top highlight) and `sticky top-0 z-40`. On a page you scroll for
  a while, the brand, nav and account menu all left the viewport, and "scroll
  back to the top to change section" is a tax paid on every navigation.

- **The Resparkable section header carries a group eyebrow.** `<SectionHeader>` now
  prints the rail group a section belongs to — Daily, Organise, Knowledge,
  Manage — above the `h1`, derived from `RESPARKABLE_NAV_GROUPS` rather than
  duplicated, longest-href-wins so `/resparkable` doesn't match everything. It is
  deliberately not the word "Resparkable": the rail head and app nav both say that,
  and this shell removed that duplication once already.

- **The signed-in app shell is full-bleed.** New `.app-shell` utility in
  `app/globals.css` (full width, gutter 1rem → 1.5rem → 2rem) replaces
  `container mx-auto px-4` in `app/(protected)/layout.tsx`,
  `components/layouts/protected-footer.tsx` and — behind a new
  **`<AppHeader fullWidth>`** prop — the header. `container` caps at the largest
  breakpoint and centres the remainder, which is right for marketing prose and
  wrong for an application with its own sidebar: on a wide display it spent
  ~450px on empty margins with the nav mid-screen. **`(public)` is unchanged** —
  `fullWidth` defaults to `false`, so the marketing header keeps the centred
  measure its sections are built on. Forks that want the old app frame back pass
  nothing and swap `.app-shell` for `container mx-auto px-4`. Filed upstream as
  Sunrise ask #35 — this is one of the few core-file edits Resparkable carries.
- **Resparkable: the section nav is a grouped rail, not fourteen pills.**
  `<ResparkableNav>` now exports `RESPARKABLE_NAV_GROUPS` — four named groups (Daily,
  Organise, Knowledge, Manage) — and derives the existing `RESPARKABLE_NAV_ITEMS`
  export from them, so a section can no longer be in the nav but outside the
  list `section-help.test.ts` checks. Above `lg` it renders as a sticky left
  rail that collapses to icons (remembered under `resparkable.nav.collapsed.v1`);
  below `lg` it is a section switcher, because fourteen stacked rows is most of
  a phone screen. The shell (`app/(protected)/resparkable/layout.tsx`) is a two-
  column flex as a result, and dropped its own "Resparkable" title block: the app
  nav and the rail head both already said it, and the product tagline under it
  duplicated the section blurb one line below. `<SectionHeader>` now carries the
  page's `h1` (was `h2`), and the board detail page's name demotes to `h2`
  behind it. `RESPARKABLE_NAV_ITEMS`, its shape, and every route are unchanged.
- **Resparkable: `POST /api/v1/resparkable/links` now goes through `linkEntities`**
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/services/links.ts`). The endpoint checks, the
  identical-404 rule and the server-pinned `origin` / `status` / `reviewedAt`
  were inline in the route; `resparkable_link_entities` needs all three, and a
  capability that reimplemented them would drift — which is exactly the
  divergence the "handlers stay thin" rule exists to prevent. Behaviour change:
  a hand-asserted link now records a `linked` `ResparkableEvent`, which it never did.
- **Resparkable: `PATCH /api/v1/resparkable/tasks/[id]/tags` is now `PUT`.** The route
  always replaced the whole tag set; it used `PATCH` only because `apiClient` had
  no `put` and adding one would have been a core-file edit. #495 landed the verb.
  **Breaking for any caller built against the old verb** — the body and response
  are unchanged.
- **Resparkable: retention capability is read from the provider, not inferred from
  its name.** `resolveRetentionCapability()` named `local` and refused it, because
  the local provider wrote into `public/uploads/` and ignored `public: false`.
  #490 gave it a private root and a signed read route, which made the name check
  **wrong in both directions** — it would refuse a local provider that can now
  hold objects privately, and go on trusting any future provider that simply
  isn't called `local`. It now reads `getStorageCapabilities()`, where an
  undeclared capability means "cannot". **Upgrade note for S3 deployments:** S3
  declares `privateObjects: useAcl || privateByDefault`, and both default to
  false. An install on `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` with neither `S3_USE_ACL` nor
  `S3_OBJECTS_PRIVATE_BY_DEFAULT` set, and `documentOriginals: 'retain'`, will
  stop retaining new uploads _and_ start returning 404 from
  `GET /api/v1/resparkable/documents/[id]/download` for originals it already holds.
  That is the correct fail-closed answer — nothing can distinguish that bucket
  from a wide-open one — and the admin settings page names the reason on screen.
  Set `S3_OBJECTS_PRIVATE_BY_DEFAULT=true` to restore retention.
- **Resparkable: `assertResparkableModelMatchesStoredVectors` delegates to the platform
  guard** exported by #491, instead of carrying ~40 duplicated lines. The fork
  still supplies owner-scoped closures — an unscoped aggregate would make one
  user's search latency grow with the whole install's corpus and let one user's
  mismatched vectors throw for everybody — and keeps its structured `logger.error`
  via catch/rethrow, because a thrown string is not queryable.
- **Resparkable: `lib/framework/resparkable/db-drift.ts` imports `generatedColumnExists`**
  from `@/lib/db/drift-probes` rather than defining its own. #481 landed it and
  switched core's A1 probe to it, closing the same blind spot upstream.

- ~~**`components/layouts/protected-nav.tsx` gains one `/resparkable` entry.**~~
  **Reverted before release.** #473 landed the `lib/app/protected-nav.ts` seam
  the entry was waiting on, so the core file is pristine again and Resparkable
  registers through the seam. Added and removed within the same unreleased cycle;
  no released version carried the edit.
- **Archiving an Resparkable item now deletes its embedding rows in the same
  transaction** as the archive (`archiveAndDropVectors()`), rather than leaving
  them behind a `WHERE archivedAt IS NULL` filter. A filtered vector search
  degrades recall silently as history grows — no error, no symptom — so the index
  only ever holds live data. The consequence, deliberately accepted, is that the
  archived corpus is keyword-searchable but not vector-searchable.

### Removed

- **`updateSpace()`** (`lib/framework/resparkable/repo/space.ts`) — replaced by
  `updateSpaceSettings()`, which takes the patch in domain terms and translates
  a `null` Json column into `Prisma.DbNull`. Added and removed within the same
  unreleased cycle; no released version exposed it.
- **`privateCacheHeaders()` and `withPrivateCache()`**
  (`lib/framework/resparkable/api/cache.ts`) — the per-route `Cache-Control`
  workaround, redundant once #487 made `private, no-cache` the default on every
  JSON envelope and on `checkConditional()`'s 304. Deleted rather than left as
  no-ops a future route author would copy without knowing. `PRIVATE_NO_CACHE`
  survives for the board export, which returns a raw `Response` and so never
  passes through the envelope helpers. Same unreleased cycle.

- **Resparkable erasure cascade was incomplete** (`20260728232937_resparkable_space_cascade`).
  The phase-1 migration gave every scoped table a plain `userId` column with no
  FK, so deleting a user removed only the `ResparkableSpace` row and left every
  task, thought, project and event behind — personal data surviving an erasure
  that reported success. Every scoped table now has a real FK to
  `framework_resparkable_space("userId") ON DELETE CASCADE`, and the migration
  deletes rows already orphaned by its absence. Found by the isolation smoke
  script against a real database; no mocked test could have caught it.
- **`ResparkableArea.targetWeeklyMinutes` and `ResparkableSpace.weeklyCapacityMinutes`**
  (`20260809123004_resparkable_drop_area_hours`), along with the `areaBalance`
  priority-scoring factor, the dashboard capacity meter, the Areas-over-capacity
  warning, and the "areas with no time logged" stale-digest section. Resparkable
  is a reflection and understanding tool, not an optimisation one. See
  `.context/framework/resparkable/design-principles.md`. Removed rather than
  hidden behind a flag, so nothing dormant remains for a later change to revive
  by accident.

### Fixed

- **Resparkable's background workflows failed on a cold server, and only on a cold
  server.** `initResparkable()` now calls `registerBuiltInCapabilities()` at boot.

  Core's capability registry is a `globalThis` singleton
  ([resparkable#462](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/462)),
  so a registration crosses module realms — but the "have I registered yet"
  guards are ordinary module-scoped booleans, so the registry is only filled
  when something *calls* the initialiser. The chat handler, the MCP tool
  registry, `getCapabilityDefinitions()` and the `agent_call` executor all do.
  `executors/tool-call.ts` does not; it dispatches straight into the registry.

  So on a process that had served no chat, agent or MCP request, the scheduler
  firing a workflow of `tool_call` steps found an empty map and every step
  failed with `unknown_capability`. That is all four Resparkable background
  workflows, at 03:15 and 04:30, on a server that has been quiet all night —
  **the failure was likeliest exactly when it mattered, and hid under load.**
  It also read as a fork bug, because the error names Resparkable's own slug while
  the fork's registration code is working perfectly.

  Found by starting the server, not by a test. Unit tests register explicitly,
  so the registry is never empty; reproducing needs a cold process *plus* a tick
  before any request. The regression test added with this asserts the registry
  *contains* a known slug after boot rather than that a function was called —
  the failure mode is an empty registry, and only a lookup proves it isn't.

  Interim: the real fix is one line in core, filed as
  [resparkable#537](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/537).

- **Every Resparkable background workflow would have failed silently after the
  Resparkable 0.8.0 merge.**
  [resparkable#502](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/502)
  made schedule-triggered runs **system-owned** — the scheduler now writes
  `userId: null` on the execution and passes `null` into the engine instead of
  `schedule.createdBy`. That is correct for the org-level cron rows core has in
  mind: `AiWorkflowExecution.userId` is `onDelete: Cascade`, so naming an
  operator meant erasing them destroyed the organisation's entire scheduled-run
  history. It is also the removal of the **only** mechanism by which Resparkable's
  per-user schedules knew whose brain a 04:30 run was working on, so
  `requireResparkableUser` would have thrown `MissingResparkableUserError` on every step
  of the nightly triage, the morning briefing, the weekly review and the horizon
  check.

  The owner now travels on the schedule row's `scope` column
  (`RESPARKABLE_SCHEDULE_OWNER_KEY`), which is the carrier core provides for exactly
  this — admin-written, validated on read, stamped onto the execution and
  threaded into `CapabilityContext.scope`, with core naming and reading no keys
  of its own. Unlike `inputTemplate` it never becomes `ctx.inputData`, so it
  cannot collide with a step's `.strict()` argument schema. `context.userId`
  still wins when both are present, so the fallback can only ever fill a gap and
  never redirect a live session at another brain. `ensureResparkableSchedules` gained
  a third correction that stamps rows written before the move — without it an
  upgraded install carries silently broken schedules for ever.

  **Nothing failed loudly, and that is the part worth keeping.** `userId` is
  already `string | null`, so the change type-checked; the 1,978 tier tests
  stayed green because they mock that boundary. A merge can be green on both
  sides and still be broken in the seam between them. Filed upstream as
  [resparkable#532](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/issues/532).

- **Resparkable's first write by any new user returned a 500.**
  `ensureResparkableSpace()` existed and was tested but was called from nowhere,
  while `20260728232937_resparkable_space_cascade` gave every scoped table a real FK
  to `framework_resparkable_space("userId")`. A user who had never had a space row
  therefore hit a foreign-key violation on the first thing they did. The space
  bootstrap now wraps `create` on every resource descriptor — the layer the HTTP
  routes and the phase-6 capabilities share — so it cannot be forgotten by a new
  entry point.

### Dependencies

- Added `d3-force` (+ `@types/d3-force`) for graph layout — `@xyflow/react` renders
  but expects coordinates — and `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` for the kanban
  board, chosen over native HTML5 drag-and-drop because that is inaccessible to
  keyboard users and unusable on touch.

### Security

- **Changing an account's email now requires approval at the old address, the
  current password, and revokes other sessions.** ([#489]) `PATCH
  /api/v1/users/me` wrote the new address straight in and mailed verification to
  it, with no re-authentication and no signal to the address being replaced — so
  a single compromised session converted into permanent account takeover: the
  address moved, the link went to the attacker, and `autoSignInAfterVerification`
  minted them an independent session. A session expires; control of the address
  does not.

  The endpoint now delegates to better-auth's `changeEmail` with
  `sendChangeEmailConfirmation`, which writes nothing until the address
  **currently** on the account approves — so a stolen session can request a
  change but not finish one. On top of that, `currentPassword` is required
  (OAuth-only accounts are exempt, having none), and the user's other sessions
  are revoked when the change lands.

  **Breaking for API callers:** an email change no longer takes effect in the
  request. A success response carries the *old* `email` plus
  `emailChangeRequested: true`, and the address moves only after approval at the
  old address and verification at the new one. Sending `email` without
  `currentPassword` is now a 400 on password accounts.

  New public surface: `changeEmailApproval` in the email registry (overridable
  in `lib/app/emails.ts`), `revokeUserSessions` (`lib/auth/sessions.ts`), and
  `parseEmailChangeToken` (`lib/auth/change-email.ts`) — the last is required
  reading before touching `sendVerificationEmail` or `afterEmailVerification`,
  since better-auth routes email changes through both with no discriminator of
  its own.

- **The chat handler now refuses tool names outside the agent's advertised
  set.** Dispatch previously took the tool name straight off the model's emitted
  call, while the dispatcher synthesizes a default-ALLOW binding when no
  `AiAgentCapability` row exists — so a capability an agent was never granted
  would execute, unrestricted. Reachable via prompt injection, or via a
  conversation resumed across a capability being revoked (the model's own
  earlier calls sit in history and invite imitation). ([#476])

- **`sanitizeUrl()` no longer passes control-character-obfuscated schemes.**
  `java<TAB>script:`, `java<LF>script:`, `javascript<TAB>:` and a leading C0
  control all bypassed the check, because it ran on `trim()` (leading/trailing
  whitespace only) while browsers strip tab/newline/CR from anywhere in a URL
  before parsing the scheme. The replacement character class also covers the
  non-ASCII whitespace `trim()` used to remove (NBSP, BOM, U+2028, the U+2000
  block, ideographic space), so the guard is nowhere narrower than the one it
  replaced — those are not browser-executable, but leaving them out would have
  been a silent narrowing. Only the inspected copy is normalised — the URL
  returned to callers is unchanged. ([#437])

- **`PATCH /api/v1/users/me` clears `emailVerified` when the address changes**
  and re-sends verification. Previously an account that verified one address
  could become a *verified* holder of any unregistered address in one request,
  turning `user.email` from "an address this person controls" into "any unused
  string they typed" — a privilege-escalation primitive for invitation
  redemption and domain allowlists keyed on the address. ([#466])

- **An API key can no longer change the account's email address** (#466,
  found reviewing that fix). `withAuth` accepts an API key of **any** scope, and
  keys are self-service — so a `chat`-scoped key handed to a third-party
  integration could have moved the account to an attacker's address, and the new
  verification mail would have delivered them a working token. With
  `autoSignInAfterVerification` enabled that token mints a real session, turning
  a read-ish scope into full account takeover. `PATCH /api/v1/users/me` now
  returns 403 on the email path for key-authenticated callers, via the new
  `isApiKeySession()` in `lib/auth/api-keys.ts`. Non-identity profile fields are
  unaffected. Re-authentication, old-address notification and session revocation
  remain open — tracked in #489.

- **JSON API responses now carry `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`** (#487).
  Nothing set a cache directive, and a response with a validator (an `ETag`,
  which several routes send) but no freshness information is *heuristically
  cacheable* — RFC 9111 §4.2.2 lets a shared cache store it and invent an expiry.
  Applied in `successResponse`/`errorResponse` and the 304 from
  `checkConditional`, so the 200 and 304 on an endpoint agree. Deliberately
  `no-cache` rather than `no-store`, which would forbid the client copy and
  defeat the conditional-GET path the ETags exist for. It is a default, spread
  before caller headers, so a route serving genuinely public data can override
  it; routes returning a raw `Response` never pass through here.

- **Schedule- and inbound-triggered runs are no longer attributed to the
  operator who configured them.** ([#502]) The inbound route stamped
  `trigger.createdBy`, and the scheduler `schedule.createdBy`, onto the
  conversation and execution rows they created. The data on those rows belongs
  to whoever sent the message — `inputData.trigger` is the adapter payload
  written verbatim (sender phone number, email From/Subject/body, base64
  attachments), and the conversation carries `fromAddress` and the full thread.

  Both `userId` columns are `onDelete: Cascade`, so **erasing one operator
  destroyed every third party's inbound conversation and run routed through any
  trigger they had configured** — `eraseUser()` reported success and the
  correspondence was gone. The same rows matched that operator on `userId`, so
  a subject-access export would have disclosed a stranger's phone number and
  email bodies to them as their own data.

  Those rows are now written system-owned (`userId = null`), which is what
  `.context/privacy/data-erasure.md` always described and what the engine was
  already built for. Migration `20260801090000_system_owned_inbound_runs`
  backfills inbound history; historical *scheduled* runs keep their author,
  because the scheduler set no `triggerSource` before this release and they
  cannot be distinguished from runs an admin started by hand.

  Three behaviour changes follow. New public surface:
  `lib/orchestration/access/execution-access.ts`
  (`adminCanViewExecution`, `executionAccessBasis`, `executionVisibilityWhere`).

  - **Admin visibility.** All 15 execution routes (including the sidebar
    counts and the live-engine dashboard, the latter via
    `getLiveEngineSnapshot`) and the conversation list, detail and search now
    admit rows nobody owns — otherwise every scheduled and inbound run would
    vanish from the UI and a run paused at an approval gate could never be
    cleared. The same widening covers three surfaces that reach execution and
    conversation rows by other routes: the resume path on `POST
    /workflows/:id/execute?resumeFromExecutionId=` (without it an approved
    system-owned run could not be continued and sat in `pending`),
    `GET /observability/dashboard-stats` (which otherwise reported a healthy
    deployment while the live-engine dashboard showed the same runs failing),
    and `POST /evaluations/datasets/:id/capture` (which otherwise 404'd on
    every attempt to capture a scheduled run's output into a dataset).
    `AccessBasis` in `conversation-access.ts` gains a third member, `'system'`,
    which is audit-logged like `'shared'`. Conversation PATCH/DELETE accept
    `'owner'` and `'system'` (still never `'shared'`), so an inbound thread can
    be deleted when the person who sent the messages asks — they have no
    account, so `eraseUser()` cannot reach them. Both mutations write an audit
    row: PATCH logs `conversation.updated` with `metadata.fields` naming what
    changed (not the values, so a renamed `title` doesn't put message content
    in the log).
  - **A resumed run keeps the user context it was created with**, alongside its
    already-pinned `versionId` and persisted `scope` — the execute route passes
    the execution row's `userId`, not the resuming admin's. Otherwise a
    system-owned run's second half would gain a user context its first half
    never had, and `judge_call` would file a stranger's transcript into the
    approving admin's history. For an owner-resume the two are the same value.
  - **`judge_call` cannot run on a scheduled or inbound workflow.** It drives
    `streamChat`, which files the judge transcript into a real account's chat
    history; borrowing the schedule's author would re-create the
    mis-attribution. The step throws `judge_call_requires_user_context`.
  - **Rerun inherits the original's attribution** rather than claiming the run
    for the admin who pressed the button, since `inputData` is copied verbatim.

  `AiWorkflowExecution.triggerSource` is now written as `'schedule'` by the
  scheduler — the value the schema documented and the scheduler never set — so
  a run with no owner still has provenance.

### Added

- **`PORT` and `EMAIL_PORT` are now read from the project's env files, so an app
  can declare the port it binds** — Next's CLI binds `--port` to `PORT` at
  argument-parse time, which happens before it loads any `.env` file. A `PORT=`
  line in `.env.local` was therefore visible to the app and invisible to the
  server hosting it, leaving `-p` on the command line as the only way to move a
  dev server. For anyone running several Resparkable-derived apps side by side —
  reverse-proxying `*.test` hostnames to loopback ports, say — that meant
  remembering which app owned which port, every time.

  `npm run dev`, `npm run start` and `npm run email:dev` now go through
  `scripts/dev-server.mjs`, which reads *only* the port variable out of the env
  files, in Next's own precedence order, and passes it to the child process.
  Resolution runs explicit `-p` flag → real environment variable →
  `.env.<NODE_ENV>.local` → `.env.local` → `.env.<NODE_ENV>` → `.env` → `3000`,
  so every existing way of setting the port keeps working and keeps outranking
  the files. Nothing else about env loading changes, and the port stays
  independent of `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` — bind loopback,
  advertise the proxied hostname.

  `EMAIL_PORT` does the same for the React Email preview server, which also
  defaults to 3000 and would otherwise collide with an app; it has no env
  binding of its own, so the launcher passes `-p`.

  The launcher is plain `.mjs` with no runtime dependency: `npm start` must
  survive a production install (`npm ci --omit=dev`), which prunes both tsx and
  dotenv. Without dotenv it still starts the server and says it could not read
  the files. Deployed containers are untouched — the Docker image runs the
  standalone server, which reads `process.env.PORT` directly.

  **For forks:** Resparkable now ships a committed `.env.development` setting
  `PORT=3010` — the one env file `.gitignore` deliberately permits, for
  non-secret settings that should travel with the repo. `npm run dev` needs no
  arguments in any clone. **Change the value in your fork:** two Resparkable-derived
  apps that both keep 3010 collide the moment they run together. See
  [`CUSTOMIZATION.md`](./CUSTOMIZATION.md#claiming-your-own-dev-port).

  Deployment is untouched. The production image copies only the standalone
  build, so neither `.env.development` nor `scripts/` reaches it; `ENV PORT=3000`
  is a real environment variable, which outranks any file; Vercel runs
  `next build` and never `npm start`; and `npm start` resolves against
  `.env.production*` / `.env`, never `.env.development`.

- **Server components now call their own API at an address the server can
  actually reach** — `getBaseUrl()` returned `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, so a server
  component rendering a page went *out* to the public hostname and back in.
  Point that hostname at a local reverse proxy terminating TLS with a
  certificate Node does not trust (Herd, Valet, mkcert) and every self-call
  fails with `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` — while the browser works
  perfectly, because it trusts the same CA the server doesn't. Pages that catch
  fetch errors then render empty: an admin user list reporting "No users found"
  against a populated database.

  `getBaseUrl()` (`lib/api/server-fetch.ts`) now resolves
  `INTERNAL_API_URL` → `http://127.0.0.1:$PORT` in development when the port is
  known → `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. Production behaviour is unchanged unless
  `INTERNAL_API_URL` is set explicitly, which is there for the same split in
  other environments — a private network where the public hostname resolves
  elsewhere. Beyond correctness, a self-call over loopback skips a round trip
  through the proxy.

  `INTERNAL_API_URL` is validated as a URL in `lib/env.ts`. It must be **this**
  app's own address; anything else would receive cookie-bearing internal
  requests.

  **New `getPublicUrl()`, and a rule for choosing between the two.**
  `getBaseUrl()` had been doing two jobs: addressing the app's own API, and
  building URLs for *other* systems to call — the inbound-webhook endpoint an
  operator pastes into Slack (`app/admin/orchestration/triggers/**`). Those
  answers are no longer the same, so a loopback internal address would have been
  rendered as a webhook URL reachable from nowhere but the developer's machine.
  `getPublicUrl()` returns the public address for anything that leaves the
  server; `getBaseUrl()` stays internal-only. The two trigger pages now use it,
  restoring exactly their previous output.

- **Hot reload now works when the app is served on a hostname rather than
  `localhost`** — Next allows only `localhost` to reach its dev endpoints and
  blocks the rest, so an app behind a local reverse proxy rendered fine but
  never hot-reloaded, logging _"Blocked cross-origin request to Next.js dev
  resource"_. Rather than have every fork hardcode its own hostname,
  `next.config.js` now derives `allowedDevOrigins` from the hostnames already in
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. Setting those to the proxied
  hostname is enough; the config never needs editing.

  New optional `ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS` adds hosts those URLs don't cover (a LAN IP
  for device testing, or a `*.myapp.test` wildcard for subdomain-per-tenant
  development). It is distinct from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — that is API CORS in
  every environment, this is hot reload in `next dev`, and Next ignores it in
  production builds.

- **Subject access (GDPR Art. 15) now has a seam, matching erasure** (#467) —
  Resparkable implemented the *erasure* half of GDPR carefully — `eraseUser()`, a
  documented per-table `onDelete` policy, an append-only receipt, a registration
  seam for app-owned cleanup — and had nothing at all for the *access* half.
  Every fork holding personal data wrote it themselves, each one independently
  re-answering the same question: which tables count?

  `exportUserData()` (`lib/privacy/export-user.ts`) assembles one subject's
  record from `SUBJECT_DATA_SOURCES` (`lib/privacy/export-sources.ts`), a
  manifest where every `User`-linked model carries an explicit disposition:
  `export` for the subject's own data, `attribution` for org config they
  authored (id + label + date — `createdBy` is attribution, not ownership, the
  same reasoning erasure uses when it retains the row and nulls the link), or a
  documented exclusion with a written reason. The export's own `meta` echoes all
  three back with row counts, so a subject can see the boundary of what they
  received rather than infer it.

  **The coverage guard is the substance of the change.**
  `tests/unit/lib/privacy/export-sources.test.ts` parses `prisma/schema/*.prisma`
  and fails if a model relating to `User` is missing from the manifest — so
  adding a table without deciding what a data subject receives breaks the build.
  Erasure gets this free: a missing `onDelete` throws `P2003` and breaks loudly.
  Access has no natural loud failure — an export that omits a table looks
  exactly like a complete answer to the person reading it, and neither they nor
  the operator who sent it can tell. Two consequences follow: sources use
  Prisma's `omit` rather than `select`, so a column added tomorrow is exported
  by default instead of silently dropped (what's omitted is credential material
  only — session tokens, password hashes, OAuth tokens, key hashes, HMAC
  secrets); and nothing is best-effort, so a source that throws fails the whole
  export, the deliberate opposite of the erasure path where hook failures are
  swallowed so app trouble can never block a deletion.

  Two sources shipped narrowed, disclosing it via a `scopeNote` in `meta`:
  inbound conversations and inbound-triggered workflow runs were written
  against the operator who configured the channel, not the person who sent the
  message, so matching on `userId` alone would have disclosed a third party's
  phone number and correspondence to the wrong subject. **Both filters were
  removed later in this same release** once [#502] fixed the mis-attribution
  they contained; a source that narrows must still carry a `scopeNote`.

  A second guard,
  `npm run smoke:export`, runs in CI beside the erasure smoke and proves against
  real Postgres what a mocked suite cannot: that every manifest query executes, and
  that a planted session token, password hash, key hash and webhook secret
  appear nowhere in the serialised bundle.

  New public surface: `exportUserData()` and `SubjectNotFoundError`
  (`lib/privacy/export-user.ts`), the `SUBJECT_DATA_SOURCES` / `EXCLUDED_SOURCES`
  manifest (`lib/privacy/export-sources.ts`), the fork seam
  `collectAppSubjectData()` (`lib/app/data-export.ts` — a static function rather
  than a boot-time registry like `erasure-hooks.ts`, because an unregistered
  export collector yields a bundle that looks complete and is not), and two
  endpoints mirroring the erasure pair: `GET /api/v1/users/me/export` (refuses
  API-key sessions — a `chat`-scoped key must not read out an entire account)
  and `GET /api/v1/users/[id]/export` for admins answering a request that
  arrives by email. Both take the `exportLimiter` sub-cap and send
  `Cache-Control: no-store`. Documented in `.context/privacy/data-export.md`.

- **`SIGNUP_MODE`, the seam to run a fork invite-only** (#463) — Resparkable ships a
  complete invitation system whose premise is that access is *granted*, beside an
  email/password signup endpoint that was unconditionally open with no config to
  close it. A fork whose product is invite-gated could only edit a core auth file
  or leave the front door open, which is easy not to notice: the invite flow
  works, the product *looks* gated, and accounts accumulate. `SIGNUP_MODE=invite_only`
  closes `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email` (better-auth `hooks.before`), every other
  un-invited account creation (`userCreateBeforeHook`, default-deny and
  deliberately path-independent — a Google signup arrives via `/callback/:id` and
  an ID-token sign-in via `/sign-in/social`, so an endpoint allowlist leaks
  silently), and the `/signup` page (proxy redirect). Only account *creation* is refused; sign-in,
  password reset and invitation acceptance are unaffected. New
  `lib/auth/signup-mode.ts` exports `isInviteOnly()`, `isFirstHumanBootstrap()`
  and `runInvitedSignup()` — the last being how a server-side path that has
  already validated an invitation exempts itself, since better-auth routes
  `auth.api.*` through the same hook as HTTP requests. `open` remains the default.

- **`lib/app/protected-nav.ts`, the authenticated-nav seam** (#473) — the nav a
  fork's *users* see was a hardcoded array in
  `components/layouts/protected-nav.tsx`, while the nav its *visitors* see had
  had a seam since #347. Set `protectedNavItems` to a `ProtectedNavItem[]` (from
  the new `lib/protected-nav/types.ts`) and it replaces `DEFAULT_PROTECTED_NAV`
  wholesale; `null` keeps the default. Items gain `exact?` (matching the public
  nav) and an optional `icon`, and the platform keeps owning admin filtering and
  active-state, so `adminOnly` works on a fork's own items.

- **`lib/app/auth-landing.ts`, the post-authentication landing seam** (#473) —
  `/dashboard` was hardcoded at a dozen decision sites across twelve files, with
  no config or scaffold, so an app whose product lives elsewhere edited all of them
  and re-resolved them on every upgrade. `appAuthLandingRoute` /
  `appAuthLandingLabel` (both `null` = platform default) resolve once through the
  new `lib/auth-landing/route.ts` (`AUTH_LANDING_ROUTE`, `AUTH_LANDING_LABEL`),
  now consumed by login, OAuth, signup, invite acceptance, email verification,
  the protected layout's brand link, the admin header and sidebar, both error
  pages and `proxy.ts`. The label moves with the route, so the user-visible copy
  on those controls stops saying "Dashboard" once a fork has moved. A route that
  is not root-relative throws at module load rather than becoming an off-site
  redirect via `safeCallbackUrl()`'s unvalidated fallback.

- **`apiClient.put()`** (#495) — the client exposed `get`/`post`/`patch`/`delete`
  and no `put`, so a fork building a genuine whole-resource replacement (a
  sub-resource collection such as tags, members or assignees) had to choose
  between editing `lib/api/client.ts` — a merge conflict on every upgrade — and
  shipping `PATCH` for something that is really a `PUT`. Same signature and same
  `request()` plumbing as `patch`; no behaviour change for existing callers.

- **`StorageCapabilities` on the storage provider interface** (#490) —
  `getStorageCapabilities(provider)` in `lib/storage/providers/types.ts` resolves
  what a backend can actually do (`privateObjects`, `signedUrls`, `download`), so
  callers stop sniffing `provider.name` to find out. The field on `StorageProvider`
  is an optional `Partial<StorageCapabilities>` and an undeclared capability reads
  as **false**: a fork's custom provider keeps compiling across an upgrade and is
  never assumed capable of something it does not implement. Read it through the
  helper, never off the provider directly.

- **`download(key)` on `StorageProvider`** (#490) — an optional, `Buffer`-based
  read path returning the new `StorageObject`. Implemented by S3 and local;
  Vercel Blob declares it unsupported. The interface could previously write and
  delete an object but never read one back, which is what forced a fork keeping
  a user's uploaded file to discard the original bytes after parsing.

- **`GET /api/v1/storage/<key>?token=…`, the signed object read route** (#490) —
  serves a privately stored object, with stateless HMAC tokens from the new
  `lib/storage/access-tokens.ts` (`generateStorageAccessToken`,
  `verifyStorageAccessToken`, `buildStorageAccessUrl`; no table, no migration).
  `LocalProvider.getSignedUrl()` mints them, which is what completes the local
  provider's private-object story. **The token is the only credential and
  grants exactly one key — there is deliberately no session fallback**, because
  storage keys encode no ownership and a bare `withAuth()` would let any
  authenticated user read any private object. Rotating `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
  invalidates every outstanding URL. Responses are always
  `application/octet-stream` + `Content-Disposition: attachment`, so
  user-uploaded HTML or SVG can't execute on the app's origin.

- **A private root for the local provider** (#490) — `LocalProviderConfig.privateDir`
  (default `.storage/private`, gitignored) holds anything uploaded with
  `public: false`, outside the tree Next serves. `createLocalProvider()` now
  takes a config argument and `createLocalProviderFromEnv()` reads
  `STORAGE_LOCAL_BASE_DIR` / `STORAGE_LOCAL_BASE_URL` / `STORAGE_LOCAL_PRIVATE_DIR`
  — the zero-argument factory meant `client.ts` could never configure the
  provider at all.

- **`S3_OBJECTS_PRIVATE_BY_DEFAULT`** (#490) — declares that the bucket blocks
  public access, so every object is already private without ACLs. This is the
  AWS-recommended posture and is invisible at the SDK level; setting it is what
  lets `S3Provider` claim `privateObjects` while leaving `S3_USE_ACL=false`.

- **`assertStoredVectorDimensions(subject)`** in
  `lib/orchestration/knowledge/embedding-dimensions.ts` — the stored-vector
  dimension guard, no longer hard-wired to `aiKnowledgeChunk` (#491). `pgvector`
  fixes dimension at the column level, so changing the active embedding model
  without re-embedding breaks every query against a vector table with a cast
  error, after paying for the embedding round trip. The knowledge corpus was
  guarded; a fork adding its own `vector(...)` table — the documented path,
  since the platform KB is a global asset and per-user scoping there is an
  anti-pattern — inherited the failure with none of the protection, and could
  only get it by copying ~40 lines that would then never learn what the original
  learns. The subject is two closures (`groupByDimension`, `exemplarModel`) plus
  a `label` and a `remediation` string, so it carries no Prisma-delegate typing
  and works for a table that is not a Prisma model at all. `search.ts` now binds
  to it; behaviour and error text are unchanged.

- **`capability.refused_not_advertised` hook event, and `warning` SSE frames on
  a refused tool call** (#488). The handler already refused a tool name outside
  the set advertised to the model for that turn, but said nothing: on the
  single-call path no frame was emitted at all, so the turn carried on and the
  UI showed an answer produced without the data the model asked for, with
  nothing anywhere explaining why. Both refusal paths now yield
  `{ type: 'warning', code }` — `tool_not_advertised` or `tool_unavailable` (the
  repeated-failure breaker) — and the not-advertised case additionally emits the
  new hook event, payload `{ conversationId, agentId, agentSlug, userId,
  toolName, advertised }`. Only the not-advertised case is audited: a name
  outside the advertised set is a hallucination or an injected tool call, which
  is a security signal, whereas the breaker is operational and already logged.
  `advertised` carries the tool set the model actually had, so a reviewer can
  see what it invented the name from.

- **`generatedColumnExists(table, column)`** in `lib/db/drift-probes.ts` — a
  drift probe for a column that must be `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED`
  (#481). `columnExists` only asks whether a column of that name is present, so
  a migration that dropped the column and recreated it as a plain one of the
  same type passes the check while the column is never populated again. Probe A1
  (`ai_knowledge_chunk.searchVector`) now uses it. That column backs the BM25
  half of hybrid knowledge search, and the half-missing failure is worse than a
  dropped index: a missing index means slow-but-correct, whereas a column that
  stopped being generated means every row written after the migration holds
  NULL — so search silently returns nothing for new content while old content
  still matches, which reads as an ingestion bug. Forks probing their own
  generated columns should prefer it over `columnExists`.

- **`ChatRequest.openingTurn` — a turn the agent opens** (#474). `streamChat`
  required a non-empty `message` and persisted it as a `role:'user'` row before
  calling the model. Right for a support chatbot; wrong for a facilitated product
  whose method is to orient the person first — the app had to send a stage
  direction *as the user*, leaving text in someone's own transcript that they did
  not write, in the model's history for the rest of the conversation, and
  filterable only by exact string match against a list of every trigger string
  ever shipped. With `openingTurn` set, `message` may be omitted: no user row is
  persisted, no `message.created` fires for a user role, and the content reaches
  the model as a `system` message. `message` wins if both are supplied. A turn
  with no `message`, no `openingTurn` and no attachments is rejected — `message`
  becoming optional made the empty turn expressible, so it is now refused
  explicitly. Attachments count as a turn: the embed surface allows an empty
  `message` when files are attached (a photo with no caption), so gating on
  empty text alone would have rejected vision turns its own route already
  accepted.
  `ChatEvent` `start.messageId` is consequently optional; the shared validator in
  `chat-events.ts` already had it optional, so the TS type was stricter than the
  wire contract, and no bundled consumer reads it off `start`.

- **`ChatRequest.messageMetadata` — caller metadata on the message row** (#475).
  `costLogMetadata` lands on `AiCostLog`; there was nothing for the message
  itself, so an app that caused a turn for its own reasons had nowhere to record
  that fact except inside the message text or an `UPDATE` against a core-owned
  table. Stored verbatim under `MessageMetadata.app`, namespaced so it can never
  collide with a platform field including one a future release adds. The handler
  never inspects it. Together with #474 this replaces sentinel-string detection
  with a structural tag.

- **`lib/app/user-created.ts` — a fork-owned seam at user creation** (#464). A
  fork that needed to react to a new account (provision a profile row, seed a
  workspace, start onboarding, push to a CRM) had to add code to
  `userCreateAfterHook` in `lib/auth/config.ts` — a security-sensitive platform
  file, and a merge conflict on every upstream sync. Register hooks with
  `registerUserCreatedHook(key, hook)`; each receives
  `{ userId, email, name, signupMethod, viaInvitation }`, so it can tell an OAuth
  account (address already verified) from an email/password one. Dispatched last
  in the after-hook, so a hook sees the account fully initialised. A hook
  **cannot reject a signup** — it runs after the row exists, and a throw is
  logged and swallowed rather than reporting a completed signup as an error. To
  gate signup itself, see #463. Empty registry = today's behaviour.

- **`lib/app/jobs.ts` — a fork-owned seam for recurring app work** (#469). The
  scheduler ran workflow schedules only, so an app's own periodic job needed
  either a second cron process and deployment target or an edit to `run-tick.ts`.
  Register with `registerAppJob({ name, intervalMs, run })` and the existing
  maintenance tick runs it when due; the return value is folded into the tick's
  completion log line. Two honest limits, documented on the seam: `intervalMs` is
  a **minimum** gap bounded below by the tick interval (60s), and last-run times
  live in process memory — so a multi-instance deployment runs each job about
  once per instance per interval, and a restart re-arms everything. Write jobs to
  be idempotent; a job needing exactly-once cluster-wide semantics needs its own
  lease. A job still running is never started again (per-job in-flight guard), a
  non-positive `intervalMs` is refused at registration rather than silently
  meaning "every tick", and a rejecting job is contained. Empty registry =
  today's behaviour, byte-for-byte.

- **`NavSection.titleNode` — a fork's own brand lockup in an admin nav section
  header** (#448). Optional `ReactNode` on `registerNavSection({ … })`; when set,
  the sidebar renders it in place of the default uppercase `title` label and
  drops the uppercase treatment. `title` stays required — it remains the React
  key, the registry's dedupe key, and the heading's `aria-label`, so a wordmark
  image cannot degrade the accessible name. Converts a two-file platform edit
  (`lib/admin-nav/registry.ts` + `components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx`) that
  conflicted on every upstream sync into a supported extension point.

- **`lib/app/csp.ts` — a fork-owned seam for third-party iframe hosts** (#450).
  `frame-src` was hardcoded to `'self'` in both policies, so a fork embedding a
  YouTube or Vimeo player had to edit `lib/security/headers.ts` — a
  security-sensitive platform file, and a recurring merge conflict. Export
  origins from `appFrameSrc` and `getCSPConfig()` folds them into the global CSP.
  Only exact `https://` origins are accepted (left-most wildcard and port
  allowed); anything else is dropped and logged at warn at module load, since
  these values are spliced into a response header. Empty in vanilla Resparkable —
  locked by `tests/unit/lib/app/defaults.test.ts`. See
  [`.context/security/overview.md`](./.context/security/overview.md#third-party-iframes--the-frame-src-seam).

- **`ProcessImageOptions.fit` — an aspect-preserving mode for logos and
  banners** (#447). `processImage()` hardcoded a centre-cropped square, which is
  right for avatars (what it was built for) and wrong for every non-square
  upload. `fit: 'inside'` treats `maxWidth` × `maxHeight` as a real bounding box
  and preserves aspect ratio; `fit: 'cover'` (the default) keeps today's
  behaviour exactly, so no existing caller changes. Both modes remain
  shrink-only. See [`.context/storage/overview.md`](./.context/storage/overview.md).

- **`<RouteErrorBoundary>` — one shared body for every route group's
  `error.tsx`** (#434). New `components/errors/route-error-boundary.tsx` holds
  the logging, Sentry reporting, optional session-expiry detection and recovery
  card that the four `app/**/error.tsx` files each carried a near-identical copy
  of; those files are now thin wrappers. A fork adding a route group writes a
  ~10-line wrapper with its own `boundaryName`, `tag` and `fallback` instead of
  a fifth copy. `fallback.navigate: 'reload'` opts into a full document load for
  boundaries where the shell itself may be broken. `app/global-error.tsx` is
  unchanged — it replaces the root layout and renders its own `<html>`/`<body>`.
  See [`.context/ui/components.md`](./.context/ui/components.md).

- **`slugify(value)`** in `lib/utils.ts` — filename/URL-safe slug. Returns the
  bare slug including the empty string (callers apply their own fallback, e.g.
  `slugify(title) || 'report'`); pure and client-safe, so the same helper works
  in a download button and in a server-side filename. ([#451])

- **`validatePathParam(raw, schema, options?)`** in `lib/api/validation.ts` —
  completes the validation family alongside `validateRequestBody` and
  `validateQueryParams`. Throws the same `ValidationError` that `handleAPIError`
  maps to a 400. Sixteen `[id]` routes drop their hand-rolled copies. ([#435])

- **`CAPABILITY_BINDING_MODE`** env var (`permissive` | `strict`, default
  `permissive` — unchanged behaviour). `strict` makes a missing
  `AiAgentCapability` row DENY instead of synthesizing a default-allow binding.
  Opt-in because it retroactively revokes capabilities agents relied on
  implicitly, including `mcp-system`. ([#476])

- **`DATABASE_POOL_MAX`** — optional cap on pg connections per process, default
  `10` (unchanged behaviour). Serverless deploys set `1` behind a transaction
  pooler; every warm instance holds its own pool, so the default exhausts a
  small Postgres under load. The pool also sets 10s idle and connection
  timeouts, so exhaustion now fails fast instead of hanging until the platform
  kills the request. ([#445])

- **Workflow schedules show their last run time**, alongside the existing next
  run. `AiWorkflowSchedule.lastRunAt` was already on the wire.

- **`framework:*` is now a reserved script namespace, and CI runs
  `framework:ci-checks`** (#483). CUSTOMIZATION.md §7 reserved `app:*` for the
  leaf-fork tier but left a framework-tier fork (one sitting between Resparkable and
  its own forks) with nowhere to put a script — while `scripts/smoke/README.md`
  actively told it to add to Resparkable-owned `smoke:*`. Both are corrected, and
  `scripts/app/` + `scripts/framework/` are now documented as tier-owned
  directories. The `lint` job calls `framework:ci-checks --if-present`, mirroring
  the existing `app:ci-checks` seam, so the reservation is real rather than a
  promise.

### Changed

- **`upload_to_storage` refuses a private-upload binding the provider cannot
  honour** (#490). A binding with `public: false` or `signedUrlTtlSeconds` now
  fails with `private_objects_not_supported` — before any upload — when the
  configured provider does not declare `privateObjects`. **This is a runtime
  break worth planning for:** an agent binding with `signedUrlTtlSeconds` on S3
  with ACLs off previously uploaded a *public* object and returned a signed URL
  to it, which looked like it worked. Set `S3_OBJECTS_PRIVATE_BY_DEFAULT=true`
  (or `S3_USE_ACL=true`) to restore it. `VercelBlobProvider.upload()` likewise
  throws on `public: false` rather than storing the file publicly — that
  provider has no private storage under any configuration.

- **`getOrchestrationSettings()` reads before it writes, and caches for 30s**
  (#442). It was an unconditional `upsert` — a write, taking a row lock, on every
  call, including several per maintenance tick — for a row that is created once
  in the lifetime of an install. It now does a `findUnique` and only upserts when
  the row is absent (still an upsert there, so two instances booting at once
  can't race the unique constraint on `slug`), behind a 30s TTL cache modelled on
  `settings-resolver.ts`. The new `invalidateOrchestrationSettingsCache()` is
  called from the settings PATCH route, so a save is visible immediately.

- **`useHealthCheck` pauses polling while the tab is hidden** (#442). It ran two
  bare `setInterval`s, so a forgotten admin tab issued `GET /api/health` — and
  therefore `SELECT 1` — every 30 seconds indefinitely, enough on its own to keep
  a scale-to-zero database awake. It now runs on `useAutoRefresh`, which already
  pauses on `document.hidden` and handles being hidden at mount. **Two semantic
  shifts for callers:** `isPolling` now means "polling is enabled" rather than "a
  timer is armed", so it stays `true` across a visibility pause; and
  `startPolling()` refreshes immediately instead of waiting out an interval.
  `autoStart: false` still fetches once on mount.

- **Deployment guidance for scale-to-zero databases** (#442).
  `scheduling.md` prescribed `* * * * *` with no note about what that costs on a
  Postgres that autosuspends when idle — a fork following the documented path
  inherited a database that was never allowed to sleep, and a bill to match. The
  recommended cadence is unchanged (the idle gate makes those ticks free), but
  the trade is now stated, with a `*/5` recipe for cutting serverless
  invocations and the price named plainly: a workflow schedule can only be as
  punctual as the cron that drives it. `resilience.md` also now records that
  `tickRunning` is per-instance, so the overlap guarantee does not hold on
  serverless.

- **The maintenance tick can now skip entirely, doing zero database work**
  (#442). Per-task intervals cut how much a tick does; they cannot make it do
  nothing, and nothing is what a scale-to-zero Postgres (Neon, Aurora Serverless
  v2) needs before it will autosuspend — one query a minute defeats a 5-minute
  timer exactly as well as twenty do. A sweep that finds nothing now arms an
  **idle gate**, and subsequent ticks return `200 { skipped: true, reason:
  'idle', resumesAt }` before any Prisma call. Skipping is bounded three ways:
  the gate never skips past known future work (the next `nextRunAt`, via the new
  `getNextScheduleRunAt()`, and the shortest registered app-job interval, via the
  new `getAppJobsMinIntervalMs()`); it re-verifies against the database at least
  every `MAINTENANCE_IDLE_MAX_SKIP_MS` (**new env var**, default 30 min, `0`
  disables the gate); and request paths that create tick-owned work — a delivery
  retry, a created or edited schedule, a queued evaluation run, an execution
  enqueued by a webhook or inbound trigger — call the new `noteMaintenanceWork()`
  to disarm it immediately. It refuses to arm unless the sweep proved there was
  nothing to do: a task that found something, a task that failed, a fired
  schedule, an errored sweep, or a failed horizon probe all leave it disarmed.
  State is per-process, so a restart always sweeps and multi-instance forks
  should lower the cap. **New:** `POST …/maintenance/tick?force=1` sweeps
  regardless (it does not bypass the overlap guard), and the skip response now
  carries `reason` — previously the only skip was the overlap guard and the
  reason string was fixed.

- **Maintenance-tick background tasks now run on per-task minimum intervals**
  (#442). All eight ran on every tick, so at the documented 60s cadence the
  retention sweep — whose windows are measured in days — ran 1,440 times a day
  and the embedding backfill full-scanned the message table just as often. Each
  task now declares the shortest gap at which it can still find work:
  `webhookRetries`, `hookRetries` and `evaluationRuns` stay on every tick
  (sub-minute backoff, one time-slice per tick); `orphanSweep` and
  `pendingExecutionRecovery` 2 min; `zombieReaper` 5 min; `embeddingBackfill`
  15 min; `retention` 1 hour. The table lives in
  `lib/orchestration/maintenance/platform-jobs.ts` and
  `BACKGROUND_TASK_NAMES` is now derived from it, so the route's published
  `backgroundTasks` list cannot drift from what actually runs. **Two visible
  effects:** a task held back by its interval reports the string `'skipped'`
  under its own key in the `Maintenance tick background tasks completed` log
  line (rather than its usual result object), so a log-based dashboard reading
  e.g. `retention.deleted` will see `'skipped'` on most ticks; and a task still
  running from an earlier tick is no longer started a second time when the
  liveness watchdog releases the overlap guard. Intervals are start-to-start and
  held in process memory — persisting them would cost a database round-trip per
  task per tick, which is the cost this change exists to remove. Every throttled
  task is idempotent, so on a multi-instance deployment the failure mode is
  "runs more often than intended", never "misses work".

- **`runStructuredCompletion`'s non-persistence is now contractual** (#472). The
  module writes nothing — no database client imported, no row created, no prompt
  or completion logged — but that was only *incidentally* true. Its docstring
  promised layering neutrality ("no evaluation coupling, no Next.js imports"),
  which says nothing about writes, while a downstream fork's user-facing privacy
  claim (calendar-event titles categorised into aggregate buckets, only the
  totals stored) depended on the stronger property. Adding prompt logging for
  debugging or completion persistence for eval replay would have been consistent
  with everything the file said about itself and would have broken that claim
  without touching the fork's code. The guarantee is now stated explicitly and
  enforced by `structured-completion-no-persistence.test.ts`, which fails on a
  database/storage import or a `prisma.*` call. Cost metadata (token counts, USD)
  is still returned to callers and is outside the guarantee — aggregate counts
  carry no prompt content. Persisting here in future is a breaking change to a
  documented guarantee: opt-in flag defaulting to off, CHANGELOG entry, and a
  deliberate test update rather than a deletion.

- **BREAKING: `HookEventType` is open to fork-owned events** (#465).
  `HOOK_EVENT_TYPES` was a closed list, so a fork could neither emit its own
  domain event through the hook registry nor subscribe a webhook to one — it had
  to add entries to a platform array, conflicting on every sync and risking a
  collision with a name a future release takes. `HookEventType` is now
  `CoreHookEventType | \`app.${string}\` | \`framework.${string}\``, matching
  the reserved tiers in CUSTOMIZATION.md, and the admin hook routes accept the
  wider set so a fork can subscribe through the same API. **Forks:** an
  exhaustive `switch` over `HookEventType` with an `assertNever` default now
  fails to compile. That is the intended failure — a compile-time prompt to
  decide what your code does with an event it doesn't know, instead of a silent
  runtime fall-through. The core enum is kept as one arm of the Zod union rather
  than replaced with `z.string()`, because that schema also validates
  `AiEventHookDelivery.payload` read back from the database.
  A namespaced union rather than a registration seam, deliberately: these schemas
  are built at module load, before any `initApp()` runs, and #462 showed boot
  order across module realms isn't guaranteed under Turbopack.
  `WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` stays **closed** and is now documented as such — a hook's
  only action type *is* a webhook, so the hook registry already gives a fork the
  whole path, and those values are rendered straight into `<select>` options and
  cross-referenced against `WIRED_WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES`, where a fork-namespaced
  value would have no label and no wired-ness answer.

- **A fork can now ADD an email kind, not just override one** (#468).
  `EmailPropsMap` is an `interface`, so declaration merging already worked in
  principle — but `defaultTemplates` was a total mapped type over `EmailKind`,
  which made every fork-added kind a compile error in a platform file the fork
  can't edit without a conflict. It is now `Partial`, and `resolveEmailTemplate`
  throws naming the kind when there is neither an override nor a default. Throwing
  rather than rendering `undefined` is deliberate: a blank email is far harder to
  diagnose than a failed send. The interface now documents the `declare module`
  recipe and recommends namespacing keys `app.` / `framework.`. No runtime change
  for the four platform kinds.

- **`prisma/schema/app.prisma` is now genuinely fork-reserved and ships empty**
  (#429). It shipped three platform models — `ContactSubmission`, `FeatureFlag`,
  `AuthBootstrap` — while the fork-facing docs described it as the place for a
  fork's own models, "clearly separate from the platform's". The three model
  definitions move verbatim into the existing `prisma/schema/platform.prisma`.
  Because the schema is multi-file, moving a model block between files changes
  no table and produces **no migration** — the models, their `@@map` names, and
  the generated client are unchanged. This makes the leaf tier symmetric with
  the framework tier's `prisma/schema/framework-*.prisma`. Forks that already
  added models to `app.prisma` need no action.

- **Error-boundary log message is now `'Route error boundary triggered'` for all
  four route groups** (#434), replacing the four per-group messages
  (`'Root error boundary triggered'`, `'Admin route error boundary triggered'`,
  …). The boundary is still identified by the structured `boundaryName` field,
  which is what log queries should key on. `app/global-error.tsx` keeps its own
  `'Global error boundary triggered'` message.

- **CI heap ceiling is now the `CI_NODE_HEAP_MB` repo variable** (default
  `5120`, unchanged). Forks whose lint job dies with exit 134 raise it in repo
  settings instead of editing `ci.yml`, so the fix survives an upstream sync.
  ([#452])

- **`tests/unit/lib/app/defaults.test.ts` is table-driven.** Filling a
  `lib/app/*` seam is expected to fail one row; pin the new value rather than
  deleting the row. Coverage also rose from 9 seams to 14. ([#480])

- **Vitest `testTimeout` raised to 30s** (from 10s) for forks with heavier
  component and integration tests. ([#454])

- **`streamChat` batches its three pre-token reads** (context, user memories,
  capability definitions) into one `Promise.all`, cutting the delay before the
  first token from three serial database round trips to one. No behavioural
  change. ([#449])

- **`CostSummaryModelRow` carries `provider`.** `GET /costs/summary`'s `byModel[]`
  rows are now `{ model, provider, monthSpend }`, grouped by both columns of
  `AiCostLog`. Consumers resolving a spend row to a catalogue entry must key on
  `provider::modelId` — `components/admin/orchestration/costs/model-index.ts`
  (`buildModelIndex` / `lookupModel`) is the shared helper. ([#436])

- **The Azure `gpt-4o` seed row ships inactive.** It shares a model id with the
  OpenAI row; an unconfigured example provider shouldn't compete for that id.
  Applied on create only, so a re-seed never deactivates a row an operator
  turned on. ([#436])

### Fixed

- **`upload(file, { public: false })` is no longer silently ignored** (#490). The
  option was accepted by every provider and honoured by roughly one: S3 dropped
  it unless `S3_USE_ACL=true`, Vercel Blob dropped it always, and the local
  provider wrote the file into `public/uploads/` where Next serves it statically
  to anyone who can guess the key. A fork storing a user's document rather than a
  public avatar got private storage, a public CDN URL, or a world-readable file
  with no way to tell which apart from sniffing `provider.name`. Each provider
  now declares what it can do, S3 warns once per process when it cannot enforce
  the request, and Vercel Blob refuses outright.

- **Local storage deletes now sweep the private root as well as the public one**
  (#490). `delete()` and `deletePrefix()` only ever touched `baseDir`. With the
  private root added, that would have made `eraseUser()` — which clears a user's
  blobs via `deleteByPrefix('avatars/<userId>/')` — a partial delete, leaving
  private files on disk after erasure. Both roots are swept, and a failure in
  either is reported rather than masked by the other's success.

- **The retention sweep reads the settings row once instead of eight times**
  (#442). `resolveRetentionDays()` fetched the same singleton row per prune, so
  one sweep spent eight round-trips retrieving six columns — 1,440 times a day at
  the documented tick cadence, and all of it wasted on a default install where
  every window is `null` and every prune no-ops. `enforceRetentionPolicies()` now
  calls the new `loadRetentionWindows()` once and passes each window down. The
  individual `pruneX()` functions are unchanged for direct callers, but their
  first parameter widens to `number | null | undefined`: `undefined` still means
  "resolve it yourself", an explicit `null` now means "skip". The coherence
  warning reads from the same loaded windows rather than issuing its own query.

- **The MCP config cache no longer collides with the maintenance-tick interval**
  (#442). `CACHE_TTL_MS` was 60s — exactly the tick cadence — so the retention
  sweep's `getMcpServerConfig()` call was a coin-flip between a hit and a miss,
  and the miss path is an `upsert`, i.e. a write taking a row lock, roughly every
  other tick. Raised to 5 minutes; invalidation on admin mutation was already
  explicit, so nothing goes stale that wasn't already.

- **The embedding backfill's anti-join has an index to use** (#442). It filters
  `AiMessage` on `role` and orders by `createdAt`, but the table was indexed on
  `role` alone, so proving the backlog empty meant a scan plus a sort that grew
  with the table — every tick, forever. Adds `@@index([role, createdAt])` and
  drops the now leading-column-redundant `@@index([role])`. **Migration:**
  `20260730140000_add_message_role_createdat_index`.

- **Tab titles and legal-page metadata now route through the `BRAND` seam**
  (#432). `SETTINGS_TAB_TITLES` and `KNOWLEDGE_TAB_TITLES` hardcoded `"Resparkable"`,
  and `useUrlTabs` writes them straight to `document.title` — so a fork with
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` set still showed "Resparkable" in the browser tab on
  `/settings` and the admin knowledge base, overriding correct layout metadata.
  The static metadata on `app/(public)/{privacy,terms,contact}` had the same
  hardcode. All now interpolate `BRAND.name`. `about/` is deliberately left
  alone — its copy describes the template itself and is fork-replaced body copy.

- **The protected error boundary's "Session Expired" card now actually renders
  when a session expires.** The session check tested `authClient.getSession()`
  for truthiness, but better-auth always resolves that call to a
  `{ data, error }` envelope — never `null` — so the condition never fired and
  the sign-in prompt only appeared when the request itself threw. The check now
  destructures `{ data: session }`, matching the other call sites in the repo.
  Pre-existing on `main` (`app/(protected)/error.tsx`), carried into the shared
  boundary by this release's refactor and fixed there.

- **Route-group error boundaries no longer double-log and double-report on
  session expiry** (#433). The logging effect included `isSessionExpired` in its
  dependency array while also setting it, so a session-expiry error re-ran the
  effect and produced two `logger.error` lines and two Sentry events. The shared
  boundary reports once per error (deps `[error]`) and drops `isSessionExpired`
  from the Sentry `extra` — it was always `false` at report time anyway.

- **`next/font/google` and `next/font/local` now resolve under Vitest.** Font
  loaders run at module scope, so a fork adding brand typography previously saw
  every test importing that layout fail at import time. Loader names are derived
  from Next's own declarations, so no fork edits a platform test file. ([#455])

- **Secret scanning keeps `--results=verified,unknown`** and ships a
  fixture/docs path allowlist instead, so forks do not have to trade away the
  unverifiable-secret class to stop false positives on example DSNs. ([#453])

- **MCP tool dispatch warms the capability registry.** A process that had only
  served MCP — no chat or workflow request yet — had an empty in-memory
  registry, so every MCP tool call failed with `Unknown capability`, built-ins
  included, while `tools/list` still listed them. ([#457])

- **Boot-registered context contributors and capability handlers survive to
  request time.** Both registries are now backed by `globalThis`, as the Prisma
  client already was. Under Next 16 + Turbopack `instrumentation.ts` runs in a
  separate module graph from route handlers, so a framework tier registering at
  boot silently vanished on the request path. ([#462])

- **`LlmOptions.timeoutMs` and `signal` reach the provider SDKs.** Both were
  documented but dropped, so a call that needed longer than the client default
  died at the default with no indication the option had been ignored. All four
  adapter paths (`chat` and `chatStream` on Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible)
  now forward them; setting neither leaves the provider default in charge.
  ([#444])

- **PDF parsing survives serverless file tracing.** The pdfjs worker is
  registered on `globalThis` from a literal import specifier, so it ships in the
  function bundle — previously every PDF upload on Vercel failed with "Setting
  up fake worker failed", while working locally. ([#446])

- **`chatStreamEventSchema` models `budget_exceeded_per_turn`.** The variant was
  missing, so `parseChatStreamEvent` returned null and consumers dropped the
  frame — and on the tool-loop-abort path it is the last frame sent, leaving an
  empty assistant turn with no explanation. ([#461])

- **Per-model cost rows no longer borrow another provider's label.** Spend served
  by OpenAI's `gpt-4o` could render as `microsoft` / "GPT-4o (Azure)". ([#436])

- **`costLogRetentionDays` below `executionRetentionDays` is rejected** at all
  three write paths (settings form, Zod schema, PATCH route against the persisted
  row). Cost logs must outlive the executions that reference them or the
  drill-down empties out under a retained execution. Installs already in that
  state get a warning per retention sweep. ([#456])

- **`prisma/schema/orchestration-agents.prisma` is formatted per the pinned
  Prisma, and CI now enforces it** (#482). `model AiAgent`'s attribute column was
  one short of what `prisma format` produces, so every fork's first `prisma format`
  dirtied a core file it never edited. Prettier doesn't touch `.prisma`, so
  `format:check` couldn't see the drift; the `lint` job now runs `prisma format`
  and fails on a non-empty diff. Whitespace only — no schema or client change.

> **Alpha release.** Ninth tagged Resparkable release. **MINOR bump** — adds new
> public surface: seven fork-facing seams and primitives requested by Daybreak
> under the fork-first pattern, all additive and inert in vanilla Resparkable until
> a fork opts in. Two chat guard seams — **`registerGuardFloorContributor`**

### Added

- **Chat guard-event seam — a fork can OBSERVE an inline guard firing
  (post-detection) and react** (#414). New `registerGuardEventContributor(key,
  contributor)` (exported from `@/lib/orchestration/chat`, with types
  `GuardEventContext` / `GuardEvent` / `GuardEventContributor`). When an inline
  guard (input / output / citation) flags, the handler calls `emitGuardEvent`
  **fire-and-forget** to contributors keyed on the turn's `(contextType,
  contextId, agentId, userId, conversationId)` with `{ guard, outcome }`, so a
  fork can notify / log / escalate without editing the guard sites. Fire-and-forget
  — it never delays or breaks the turn (contributors run on a microtask; a
  throwing/rejecting contributor is swallowed), it fires before the `block`
  short-circuit so a block is still observed, and an empty registry is inert.
  Observation only — it cannot change detection or the guard's action (use the
  guard-floor seam for that). Fork-owned scaffold
  `lib/app/guard-event-contributors.ts`. The post-detection sibling of the
  guard-floor seam (#413).
- **Chat guard-floor seam — a fork can RAISE an inline guard to a minimum for a
  turn** (#413). New `registerGuardFloorContributor(key, contributor)` (exported
  from `@/lib/orchestration/chat`, with types `GuardKind` / `GuardMode` /
  `GuardFloors` / `GuardFloorRequest` / `GuardFloorContributor`). A contributor
  keyed on the turn's `(contextType, contextId, agentId)` returns a per-guard
  **minimum** mode for the three inline guards (input / output / citation), and
  the handler raises each guard to the strictest registered floor. **A floor
  only ever RAISES a guard, never lowers it** (`none` < `log_only` <
  `warn_and_continue` < `block`); an empty registry leaves guard-mode resolution
  byte-for-byte unchanged, and a throwing contributor is skipped. Fork-owned
  scaffold `lib/app/guard-floor-contributors.ts` (`initAppGuardFloorContributors()`).
- **`CapabilityContext` now carries the resolved binding's `customConfig` +
  `isEnabled`** (#411). The dispatcher populates `context.customConfig`
  (`AiAgentCapability.customConfig`, normalised to an object or `null`) and
  `context.isEnabled` from the per-agent binding it already resolves at step 4,
  so a capability can read its own per-binding config inside `execute()` without
  re-querying `AiAgentCapability`. Both are set on a shallow copy (the caller's
  context object is untouched) and stay opaque carriers alongside `scope` — core
  sets `customConfig` but reads no keys, so consumers must still validate it
  (e.g. Zod). `AgentCapabilityBinding` gains a matching `customConfig` field.
  Inert for existing capabilities (they may adopt it to drop their own lookup);
  no behaviour change.
- **Consumer chat request accepts an opaque `scope` map** (#415).
  `consumerChatRequestSchema` (`POST /api/v1/chat/stream`) now takes an optional
  `scope: Record<string, string>`, threaded verbatim into every capability
  dispatch for the turn as `CapabilityContext.scope` — the same carrier the
  internal chat handler already threads. Inert in vanilla Resparkable (no built-in
  reads it); a fork can surface-scope a consumer conversation without shadowing
  the route. Because it arrives on an untrusted end-user request it is bounded
  (≤ 32 entries, keys ≤ 100 chars, values ≤ 500 chars), and a fork reading it
  for access decisions must re-validate against the user's entitlements — a
  consumer-supplied scope is a hint, not an authorization grant.
- **`findResumableConversation` — resume a surface's conversation by its context
  tuple** (#416). New helper (exported from `@/lib/orchestration/chat`, with type
  `ResumableConversationQuery`) that resolves a user's most-recent-active
  conversation for a `(userId, agentId, contextType, contextId)` surface, ordered
  by `updatedAt` desc, or `null` if none. Core already **binds** that tuple onto a
  conversation at creation and **injects** entity context for it (`buildContext`)
  but had no resume-by-tuple path — a "surface" (a stable place a user returns to)
  had to re-derive the query. The lookup is always scoped to `userId` + `agentId`
  + `isActive`, so centralising it also removes the risk a hand-rolled copy omits
  `userId` (a cross-user leak). Deciding *when* to resume stays the caller's job
  (the handler never resumes by tuple on its own); the existing
  `@@index([contextType, contextId])` supports it — no migration. Inert in vanilla
  Resparkable (no core surface calls it).

### Changed

- **Context builder threads per-request `userId` + partitions its cache by
  user** (#412). `buildContext` and `invalidateContext` take an optional third
  argument — a generic `ContextRequest { userId? }` (new exported type) — passed
  through to each `ContextContributor` (its loader signature widens to
  `(id, request) => Promise<string>`), and the 60 s result cache now keys on
  `(type, id, userId)` instead of `(type, id)`. Lets a fork return **per-user**
  prompt context without risking a cross-user cache leak. An empty/absent
  `userId` collapses to a single shared partition — byte-for-byte the previous
  behaviour — and a loader that ignores the new arg (`(id) => …`) stays valid.
  The streaming handler passes the turn's `userId` at all three call sites.
- **LLM structured-completion runner relocated to a neutral home** (#410). Moved
  `runStructuredCompletion` (with `StructuredCompletionOptions` /
  `StructuredCompletionResult`) out of
  `lib/orchestration/evaluations/parse-structured.ts` into
  `lib/orchestration/llm/structured-completion.ts` — it is a general LLM utility
  with no evaluation coupling, so a non-evaluation caller no longer imports
  through an eval-shaped path. The `phase` option widens from the closed
  `'summary' | 'scoring'` union to an open `string`, letting a caller tag its own
  span/cost phase (e.g. `'slot-extraction'`). No behaviour change: the OTEL
  attributes (`gen_ai.operation.name`, `resparkable.evaluation.phase`) and the
  omitted-`phase` default (`'evaluation'`) are unchanged. The `tryParseJson` /
  `stripCodeFence` JSON parse helpers remain in `parse-structured.ts` (every
  caller is an evaluation grader).

### Security

- **Admin MCP API-key audit no longer records the key hash.** The
  `PATCH /api/v1/admin/orchestration/mcp/keys/:id` handler diffed a full-row
  `existing` against a narrower `select`-ed `updated`, so `computeChanges`
  recorded every column present only on `existing` — including `keyHash` (the
  SHA-256 of the key), which `SECRET_PATTERN` did not redact — as a spurious
  `→ undefined` change on **every** PATCH, writing the hash into
  `AiAdminAuditLog.changes`. Both rows are now fetched through the same
  projection (which omits `keyHash`/`scopedAgentId`/`createdBy`), and
  `SECRET_PATTERN` additionally redacts `key`/`token` digest fields (`keyHash`,
  `tokenHash`) as defense in depth — without over-redacting non-secret digests
  like `fileHash`/`contentHash`. The hash is not the key and the log is
  admin-only, so impact is low — but a credential-derived value no longer sits
  in the audit table. (#388)

### Added

- **Capability `register` options — `slug` override + pre-execute `guard`.**
  `capabilityDispatcher.register(capability, options?)` and
  `registerAppCapability(capability, options?)` now accept an optional
  `{ slug?, guard? }` (new exported types `CapabilityRegisterOptions`,
  `CapabilityGuard`, `CapabilityGuardDecision`). `slug` overrides the in-memory
  handler key so a fork can mount one capability class under a namespaced slug;
  `guard` is an async-capable predicate run as dispatch **step 4a** (after the
  per-agent binding, before the rate limiter) that reads the generic
  `CapabilityContext.scope` and returns `{ allow, reason? }` — `{ allow: false }`
  (or a throw) denies with the new `capability_guard_denied` code, failing
  **closed**. Together they let a fork mount and scope-gate a capability
  **without wrapping it** — a wrapper would have defeated `register()`'s
  PII-redaction own-property check, so both options keep that guard inspecting
  the real subclass. Hard contract: an override `slug` must map to an **active
  `AiCapability` row** or dispatch dies at `capability_inactive` before the
  handler/guard runs. Both fields are opt-in; core attaches no guards and uses
  no slug overrides, so vanilla behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged. (#398)
- **`lib/app/knowledge-access-contributors.ts` — fork-owned knowledge
  access-contributor seam.** A new `lib/app/**` seam mirroring
  `registerContextContributor`: a fork registers
  `registerAgentAccessContributor(key, (agentId) => Promise<{ documentIds?, tagIds? }>)`
  to **widen a restricted agent's searchable document set** from a relationship
  it owns (module membership, team ACL, per-tenant grant), composed **live** by
  `resolveAgentDocumentAccess()` instead of materialising derived grants onto the
  per-agent pivot (which has no provenance column, making copy-down
  clobber-or-leak). Contributors run only in the `restricted` branch (a `full`
  agent is never touched) and can only **widen**; contributed `tagIds` expand to
  their documents like a tag grant; a contributor that throws is logged and
  ignored; an empty registry is byte-for-byte the previous behaviour. When the
  data a contributor reads changes, the subsystem calls the existing
  `invalidateAgentAccess(agentId)`. (#403)
- **`lib/app/eslint.config.mjs` + `app:ci-checks` — fork-owned ESLint & CI
  seams.** A fork can now add its own ESLint import-boundary rules and CI checks
  without editing platform-owned files (which would conflict on every
  `git merge vX.Y.Z`). The root `eslint.config.mjs` imports and spreads the
  reserved `lib/app/eslint.config.mjs` (ships `export default []`) as its **last**
  argument, so fork blocks land after core and win for their own `files`; the
  seam header documents the load-bearing spread order and the flat-config
  `no-restricted-imports` **replace-not-merge** footgun (restate the `@/`-alias
  ban per glob). The CI `lint` job runs `npm run app:ci-checks --if-present`, so
  a fork adds an `app:ci-checks` script to `package.json` with **no `ci.yml`
  edit** (no-op in vanilla Resparkable). Both default to inert. (#382)
- **`lib/app/bootstrap.ts` — fork-owned server boot seam (`initApp`).** A new
  `lib/app/**` seam: `instrumentation.ts` `register()` calls the reserved,
  empty-by-default `initApp()` once per server process for one-time startup work
  (warm a cache, start a worker, boot a framework tier). It runs in **every**
  environment (placed above the dev-only maintenance-ticker guards) and is
  isolated in a try/catch, so a fork's boot failure is logged but never crashes
  instrumentation or stops the dev ticker arming. Core imports only
  `@/lib/app/bootstrap`; a fork imports its own tier **dynamically** from there
  (a static `@/lib/framework` specifier breaks `next build` in vanilla Resparkable).
  Also **reserves a second fork-namespace tier, `/framework`**, for
  framework-layer forks that sit between Resparkable and their own leaf forks
  (`lib/framework/`, `.context/framework/`, `prisma/schema/framework-*.prisma`,
  the `framework_` table prefix) — Resparkable core never creates files or tables
  there, generalising #371's `/app` (leaf) reservation to two tiers. Default
  (empty `initApp`) is unchanged behaviour. (#385)
- **`lib/app/protected-routes.ts` — fork-owned protected-route registry.** A new
  `lib/app/**` seam: a fork lists extra authenticated route prefixes in
  `appProtectedRoutes` (ships empty) and the proxy **merges** them with the core
  prefixes (`/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/profile`) for the edge redirect-to-login,
  instead of editing the `proxy.ts` literal. Append semantics (core prefixes always
  stay protected); malformed entries not starting with `/` (e.g. an empty string
  that would match every path) are dropped. This is only the "is-logged-in-at-all"
  edge gate — per-resource authorisation stays in the `withAuth`/`withAdminAuth`
  guards. Default (empty list) is unchanged behaviour.
- **Payload-derived inbound scope — `NormalisedTriggerPayload.scope`.** An inbound
  adapter's `normalise()` may now return an optional `scope` (a flat string→string
  map) computed from the verified request body, letting an event-triggered run be
  scoped by what the caller sent (e.g. a fork's GitHub adapter mapping a
  `pull_request` repo to `{ projectId }`). The inbound route runs the
  adapter-returned value through the shared `resolvePersistedScope` validate-on-read
  guard (adapters aren't trusted to return well-formed data — malformed drops to
  unscoped) and shallow-merges it **under** the static `AiWorkflowTrigger.scope`,
  so the operator's config wins on key conflicts. Core's built-in adapters leave it undefined; derivation is
  fork-specific. Completes the `CapabilityContext.scope` trigger-entry population
  (the static half shipped alongside).
- **`AiWorkflowSchedule.scope` + `AiWorkflowTrigger.scope` (nullable JSON) —
  trigger-entry scope population.** Scheduled and inbound-triggered workflow runs
  can now carry a static application-level `scope` (a flat string→string map),
  stamped onto the created `AiWorkflowExecution.scope` so capabilities inside the
  run enforce it. A schedule/trigger's `scope` is settable as opaque JSON via the
  admin schedule/trigger create + PATCH endpoints (clearing uses the
  `Prisma.DbNull` sentinel); the admin `POST /workflows/:id/execute` +
  `execute-stream` routes accept an optional `scope` for a manual run. Persisted
  values are validated on read via a new shared helper `resolvePersistedScope`
  (`lib/orchestration/scope.ts`) — a malformed row is dropped to unscoped (never
  wedges a run) — which also now backs the engine resume path. The generic
  webhook trigger is deliberately left unscoped: scoped event triggers use the
  inbound-adapter seam. Core names no keys; `NULL`/unset is unchanged behaviour.
  The second populator of the `CapabilityContext.scope` carrier (after the MCP
  key); payload-derived (dynamic) scope for inbound adapters is tracked
  separately.
- **`McpApiKey.scope` (nullable JSON) — per-key scope population.** An MCP API
  key may now carry an optional application-level `scope` (a flat string→string
  map, distinct from the coarse protocol `scopes` array). It is validated on read
  (`mcpKeyScopeSchema`) and folded into `CapabilityContext.scope` for every
  `tools/call` made with the key (the dormant `callMcpTool` param from the MCP
  `tools/call` work is now populated), so an external MCP caller's tool calls are
  automatically scoped without passing scope on each call. Settable as opaque JSON
  via the admin key create/PATCH endpoints (clearing uses the `Prisma.DbNull`
  sentinel); a malformed stored value is dropped at auth (key treated as unscoped)
  rather than failing authentication. Core names no keys; `NULL`/unset is
  unchanged behaviour. First populator of the `CapabilityContext.scope` carrier;
  workflow trigger entry points are tracked separately.
- **`AiWorkflowExecution.scope` (nullable JSON) + workflow `tool_call` scope
  threading.** Completes the `CapabilityContext.scope` seam (0.5.0) on the
  workflow path. A run started via `OrchestrationEngine.execute` may now carry
  an optional `scope` (`ExecuteOptions.scope`); it is persisted on the execution
  row so it survives crash-resume (the resume path reads it back, validated by
  `workflowScopeSchema`, and rethreads it into the rebuilt `ExecutionContext`),
  and every capability dispatch forwards it — the `tool_call` executor and the
  `agent_call` tool-use loop (so `orchestrator` delegations are scoped too).
  Core names
  no keys and no built-in capability reads it; `NULL`/unset leaves behaviour
  unchanged. With the MCP `tools/call` path (above), `scope` now reaches
  capability `execute()` on all three dispatch paths (chat, MCP, workflow).
  The execution **rerun** endpoint inherits the original run's `scope`
  (alongside its inputData / budget / version), and the `run_workflow`
  capability inherits the parent run's `scope` into a sub-workflow — so
  a capability at any workflow depth sees the run's scope.

### Changed

- **MCP `tools/list` is scoped to the key's agent (list/call parity).** When an
  MCP API key is bound to an agent (`scopedAgentId`), `tools/list` now hides
  capabilities **explicitly disabled** for that agent (an `AiAgentCapability`
  row with `isEnabled = false`) — so a scoped key can no longer *discover* a
  tool it would then be refused on *call* (since #380, `tools/call` dispatches
  under the scoped agent). Scoping stays **default-allow**: capabilities with no
  binding row remain listed and callable; only explicit disables are honoured.
  Unscoped keys see the full global list, unchanged. The shared
  `capability_disabled_for_agent` dispatcher error message no longer embeds the
  internal agent cuid (it's surfaced verbatim to MCP clients); the id stays in
  server logs only. (#381)
- **`send_notification` step interpolates the `to` recipient.** The email
  recipient(s) are now run through the same `{{…}}` interpolation as `subject`
  and `bodyTemplate`, and the **resolved** value is validated as an email at
  runtime (a template resolving to a non-email fails the step non-retriably with
  `INVALID_RECIPIENT`). A literal `to` is still validated as an email when the
  step config is parsed at execution start (`INVALID_CONFIG` on a mistyped
  literal) and behaves identically. This lets a per-user scheduled workflow
  template the recipient (`to: '{{input.userEmail}}'`) with the built-in step
  instead of a bespoke `sendEmail` capability. The exported
  `sendNotificationConfigSchema` relaxes `to` accordingly: a plain string with no
  template token is still validated as an email; a `{{…}}` template is accepted
  and validated on resolution.
- **`callMcpTool()` signature** — the third parameter changed from
  `userId: string | null` to a caller object
  `{ userId: string | null; scopedAgentId?: string | null; scope?: Record<string, string> }`.
  This lets an MCP tool call run under the API key's scoped agent and carry the
  optional per-dispatch `scope` carrier (`CapabilityContext.scope`, added in
  0.5.0) through to `execute()`. Direct callers passing a bare `userId` must
  wrap it as `{ userId }`.

### Fixed

- **Workflow template namespace `{{trigger.*}}` did not resolve.** The engine's
  `interpolatePrompt` had no `trigger.` branch, so a documented, widely-used token
  like `{{trigger.conversationId}}` / `{{trigger.text}}` (the default config for
  inbound-triggered `chat_turn` steps, and what the step's own error messages tell
  you to use) silently expanded to the empty string — an inbound-triggered
  `chat_turn` would fail with `missing_conversation_id` / `missing_message` on
  every real run. `{{trigger.<dotted.path>}}` now reads an inbound run's data —
  the verified adapter payload (`inputData.trigger`) with a fallback to the
  resolved envelope (`inputData.triggerMeta`), so `{{trigger.text}}` reads the
  payload and `{{trigger.conversationId}}` the envelope where the resolved id
  actually lives. It also works inside `{{#if …}}` conditionals. The bug was
  masked because the `chat_turn` unit + inbound integration suites **mocked**
  `interpolatePrompt` with a stub that faked `trigger.` support (and fabricated a
  `trigger.conversationId` shape production never emits); both now exercise the
  real interpolator against the real inbound shape. Also corrected the workflow-builder editors'
  help text (`{{steps.<stepId>.output}}` → `{{<stepId>.output}}`; there is no
  `steps.` prefix) and stopped the builder's `send_notification` check from
  false-flagging a valid array-shaped `to` as "needs recipients".
- **MCP `tools/call` ignored the API key's `scopedAgentId`.** Tool calls always
  ran under the shared `mcp-system` agent, so cost/budget attribution and
  knowledge-base grant resolution (`resolveAgentDocumentAccess`) did not honour a
  scoped key — inconsistent with the `resources/read` path, which already
  resolved via `scopedAgentId`. `tools/call` now resolves the executing agent
  from the key's `scopedAgentId` when set, falling back to `mcp-system` for
  unscoped keys (unchanged behaviour for keys with no scoped agent).
- **Admin config-update audit diffs no longer record a spurious `updatedAt`
  change.** Nine admin orchestration PATCH routes (`settings`, `mcp/settings`,
  `triggers/:id`, `providers/:id`, `workflows/:id`, `knowledge/tags/:id`,
  `hooks/:id`, `webhooks/:id`, `agent-profiles/:id`) diffed the pre-update row
  against the post-update row without ignoring Prisma's `@updatedAt` column,
  which bumps on every `update()` — so `AiAdminAuditLog.changes` recorded a
  timestamp `from`/`to` on **every** edit, drowning the real field changes. All
  nine now pass `ignoreKeys: ['updatedAt', 'createdAt']` to `computeChanges`,
  matching the `agents/:id` route that already did. Signal-quality only — no data
  exposure. (#396)

### Added

- **`CapabilityContext.scope?: Record<string, string>`** — an optional, free-form
  scope map the dispatcher's caller can populate; the dispatcher threads it
  verbatim into `execute()`. Generic by design: core names no keys and no
  built-in capability reads it. The chat handler threads it from a new
  `ChatRequest.scope`. Lets a downstream consumer make a capability refuse to run
  outside its intended scope. Inert (`undefined`) when unused. (#372)
- **`registerContextContributor(type, loader)`** (exported from
  `@/lib/orchestration/chat`) — registers a prompt-context loader for a new
  `buildContext` `contextType`, so a fork can inject its own `LOCKED CONTEXT`
  block per turn without editing the core switch. Built-in cases take precedence;
  the 60 s per-`(type, id)` cache and invalidation behaviour are preserved. A
  contributor (or the fork's one-time init) that throws is caught and degraded
  so a loader error never fails the chat turn; the errored-contributor
  placeholder alone is returned uncached, so a transient loader failure
  self-heals on the next turn. Auto-wired once via the new fork-owned empty
  scaffold
  `lib/app/context-contributors.ts` → `initAppContextContributors()` (mirrors
  `lib/app/capabilities.ts`). (#372)

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-01

> **Alpha release.** Sixth tagged Resparkable release. **PATCH bump** — no change to
> the covered public surface (see [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#covered)):
> one backward-compatible enhancement to an uncovered `lib/db/` helper plus
> routine dependency and CI maintenance. Cut as a clean forking point. Ships in
> `0.x` per [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#0x-alpha-semantics--loose-by-design).

### Changed

- `executeTransaction()` (`lib/db/utils.ts`) now accepts an optional second
  argument forwarding Prisma's interactive-transaction options
  (`timeout`, `maxWait`, `isolationLevel`) to `prisma.$transaction`. Fully
  backward-compatible — existing callers keep Prisma's defaults (5000 ms
  timeout / 2000 ms maxWait). Lets forks raise the ceiling for genuinely heavy
  callbacks (e.g. bulk imports over remote/pooled Postgres) without patching the
  core utility. [#368]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-30

> **Alpha release.** Fifth tagged Resparkable release. **MINOR bump** — adds new
> public surface: the per-surface theming seam (`data-surface` + the fork-owned
> `classifySurface` / `DEFAULT_SURFACE` policy in `lib/app/surface.ts`,
> `<SurfaceSync>`, and the empty `app/brand-theme.css`), the agent field registry

> the new point-in-time model (see the Changed entry).

### Added

- **Legal-name brand seam (`BRAND.legalName` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_NAME`).** The
  public footer copyright now attributes to a fork's legal entity rather than its
  product name. `lib/brand.ts` gains `legalName`, defaulting to
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_NAME` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` → `"Resparkable"`, so a fork that
  only renames the app is byte-for-byte unchanged; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_NAME`
  (registered in `lib/env.ts`) when the copyright holder differs from the product
  (e.g. product "ConQuest" © "All Too Human Ltd"). Deliberately broader than
  "copyright holder" so it can later drive other legal surfaces (Terms/Privacy
  boilerplate, email footers). See `CUSTOMIZATION.md` §2. (#363)

- **Per-surface theming seam (`data-surface`) + fork-owned `app/brand-theme.css`.**
  A fork can now repaint one rendering surface (e.g. its consumer-facing pages)
  with its own palette/typography while leaving others (e.g. `/admin`) on the
  Resparkable defaults — without editing `app/globals.css` or any platform layout.
  `proxy.ts` classifies each request via the fork-owned `classifySurface(pathname)`
  policy seam (`lib/app/surface.ts`, exporting the `Surface` type) and forwards an
  `x-surface` request header; the root layout renders `<html data-surface>`; the
  new `<SurfaceSync>` client component (`components/surface-sync.tsx`) keeps that
  attribute correct across App Router navigation. The fork's per-surface CSS-variable
  overrides live in `app/brand-theme.css`, which **ships empty** — vanilla Resparkable
  is visually unchanged until a fork fills it. Documented (including the six
  design constraints — `<html>`-level marker for portals, the client re-sync, the
  subtree pin, the two dark-mode selector forms, the `:has()` backdrop, and
  unlayered overrides) in
  [`.context/ui/surface-theming.md`](.context/ui/surface-theming.md).
- **Agent field registry + fork-owned `lib/app/agent-fields.ts` seam.** A single
  declarative descriptor per `AiAgent` config field
  (`lib/orchestration/agents/agent-field-registry.ts`, exporting `AGENT_FIELDS`,
  the `AgentFieldDescriptor` type, and the `versionedFieldNames` /
  `snapshotFieldNames` / `fieldLabels` / `fieldToTab` / `fieldOrder` selectors)
  replaces the ~15 disconnected hand-maintained field lists that previously had
  to be kept in lockstep. The scalar set is exhaustiveness-checked against
  Prisma's generated `AiAgentScalarFieldEnum`, so adding a column without a
  descriptor is a compile error rather than a silent runtime gap. Forks add
  their own agent fields in the empty fork-owned scaffold `lib/app/agent-fields.ts`
  (`appAgentFields`) without editing a platform list. The registry is the source
  of truth (derived) for the versioning, snapshot, diff, restore, PATCH, and
  clone surfaces; parity tests keep the create/update validation schemas and the
  export bundle / full-backup schemas in lockstep with it, so adding a field to
  one without the other is a loud test failure. Documented in
  [`.context/orchestration/agent-fields.md`](.context/orchestration/agent-fields.md).
- **`AiKnowledgeDocument.slug` — stable cross-environment export key** (`@unique`,
  added by migration `20260629120000_add_knowledge_document_slug` with a
  deterministic backfill). Mirrors `KnowledgeTag.slug`: the slug is
  `slugify(name) + '-' + first8(fileHash)` (helper
  `lib/orchestration/knowledge/document-slug.ts` — `buildDocumentSlugBase`,
  `generateUniqueDocumentSlug`), so the same document keys identically in any
  environment. This is the prerequisite that lets **agent→document grants
  round-trip** through export/import and backup/restore (#338). `slugify` is now
  exported from `lib/orchestration/knowledge/chunker.ts`. Documented in
  [`.context/orchestration/knowledge.md`](.context/orchestration/knowledge.md).
- **Newly-exported validation surfaces** (`lib/validations/orchestration.ts`):
  `createAgentObjectSchema` / `updateAgentObjectSchema` (the agent create/PATCH
  field shapes without their cross-field refinement, so other call sites — e.g.
  version restore — can reuse the same per-field validators) and
  `bundledAgentSchema`; plus `agentBackupSchema` from
  `lib/orchestration/backup/schema.ts`. Exported to anchor the registry parity
  tests.

### Changed

- **Agent version snapshots are now point-in-time** (`AiAgentVersion.snapshot`
  holds the config _as of_ that version, the post-save state — previously it held
  the pre-update state). "Restore to vN" now reproduces the agent exactly as it
  was at vN, so version labels match their content and the newest row equals the
  live agent. Every agent now gets an explicit **`v1` ("Initial configuration")**
  at create and clone, a new seed unit (`020-agent-initial-versions`) backfills
  one for pre-existing agents, and the first edit of a legacy agent with no rows
  backfills its pre-edit state as `v1` — so a single later edit is always
  recoverable. New shared helper `lib/orchestration/agents/agent-versioning.ts`
  (`buildAgentSnapshot`, `nextAgentVersionNumber`, `INITIAL_VERSION_SUMMARY`).
  _Existing pre-`0.x` version rows are reinterpreted under the new model; during
  `0.x` alpha this is acceptable (forks expect migration work between releases)._
- **System agents are now version-restorable.** `POST /agents/:id/versions/:versionId/restore`
  no longer returns 403 for `isSystem` agents; it applies the snapshot while
  skipping the read-only fields (`slug`, `systemInstructions`, `isActive`),
  mirroring the PATCH route's guards. (Resolves the open question in #330.)
- **Agent→document grants now round-trip through export/import and backup** (#338).
  The agent bundle (`bundledAgentSchema`) carries a new `knowledgeDocumentSlugs`
  array; `POST /agents/export` emits it and `POST /agents/import` reconnects it by
  `AiKnowledgeDocument.slug`, **failing the whole import** with an actionable
  message when a referenced document is absent (matching the existing
  profile/tag behaviour). The full backup schema bumps to **`schemaVersion: 3`**:
  document grants move from `grantedDocumentHashes` (`fileHash`) to
  `grantedDocumentSlugs` (`slug`); v2 bundles still import (the importer falls back
  to `fileHash` lookup when no slugs are present, and document misses there remain
  warn-skip, consistent with the backup importer's leniency).

### Fixed

- **Backup import to a fresh environment no longer crashes on `knowledgeCategories`.**
  The full-config backup importer's agent CREATE branch spread the parsed agent
  into `prisma.aiAgent.create`, leaking the wire-only `knowledgeCategories` field
  (kept for old-bundle back-compat) whose column was dropped in Phase 6. Prisma
  rejected the unknown argument and rolled back the entire import — exactly the
  primary disaster-recovery / new-environment restore path (the UPDATE/overwrite
  path was unaffected). The field is now stripped before the spread, and a
  regression test exercises the CREATE path against a create that rejects unknown
  arguments (the prior tests mocked it away). (#353)

- **Agent version restore now reconnects knowledge grants and `knowledgeAccessMode`.**
  Restore previously left an agent's tag/document grants and access mode at their
  current values (the grants were captured in the snapshot but never reapplied,
  and `knowledgeAccessMode` was deliberately skipped to avoid pairing it with
  stale grants — see #333). Restore now reapplies the snapshot's grants (dropping
  any tag/document deleted since, so a stale id can't FK-fail the restore) and
  mode together, then invalidates the access-resolver cache so the next chat turn
  sees the restored scope.

- **Email subject lines now honor the `BRAND.name` seam.** Five transactional
  email subjects (contact-form notification, welcome on signup, welcome after
  verification, user invitation, admin webhook test) hardcoded the literal
  `"Resparkable"` while their bodies already used `BRAND.name` — so a fork setting
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` got branded bodies but stale subjects (and a
  subject/body mismatch on the invitation). All five now interpolate
  `BRAND.name`. Vanilla Resparkable is unchanged (the name defaults to `"Resparkable"`).
- **Full-config backup no longer silently drops agent fields.** The
  backup/restore agent schema, exporter, and importer had drifted from the
  `AiAgent` model and omitted `kind`, `reasoningEffort`, `persona`, `guardrails`,
  the three inheritance `*Mode` fields, the three attachment toggles, and the two
  runtime-prompt fields — so exporting and re-importing a config reset a `judge`
  agent to `chat` and lost persona/guardrails/toggles. All are now serialized and
  restored (additive, optional-with-default schema fields, so older bundles still
  import unchanged). A registry parity test now fails if any config field is
  missing from the bundle or backup schema.
- **Agent version history no longer silently loses fields.** `persona`,
  `guardrails`, `personaMode`, `voiceMode`, and `guardrailsMode` were treated as
  versioned (editing them logged a "changed" version) but were never written to
  the snapshot, so the change was unrecoverable; `reasoningEffort` and
  `maxCostPerTurnUsd` were captured but invisible in the diff viewer. All are now
  snapshotted, diffed, and restored. Version **restore** likewise applies the
  full versioned field set (previously its hand-maintained apply-list dropped
  persona/guardrails/modes and the knowledge/runtime-prompt fields) and validates
  the stored snapshot against the same per-field rules a PATCH uses.

### Added

- **Fork-readiness seams — header/footer brand, public nav, and auth emails.**
  Three near-universal fork customizations no longer require editing
  Resparkable-core files in place (which conflicts on every upstream sync); each is
  now a **fork-owned scaffold** the platform auto-resolves against, with a
  platform default. New public surface: the `<BrandMark>` slot
  (`components/brand/brand-mark.tsx`) — the header/footer brand is a render
  concern (image/wordmark/text), so the seam is a component; `AppHeader` renders
  it where it previously hardcoded `'Resparkable'`, and `logoText` becomes an
  optional caller override with no default. The public-nav override
  (`lib/app/public-nav.ts`) exports `publicNavItems` / `footerNavItems` /
  `footerLegalItems` (`PublicNavItem[] | null`, default `null` = platform
  default; a non-null array **replaces** it wholesale), with the shared
  `PublicNavItem` type and `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_NAV` / `DEFAULT_FOOTER_NAV` /
  `DEFAULT_FOOTER_LEGAL` in `lib/public-nav/types.ts`; the footer's **Cookie
  Preferences** consent control is always rendered regardless of the legal
  override. The email resolver (`lib/email/registry.ts`) adds
  `resolveEmailTemplate(kind, props)`, the `EmailKind` union, the typed
  per-kind `EmailPropsMap` props contract, and `EmailOverrides`; forks register
  per-kind overrides in `lib/app/emails.ts` and platform call sites
  (`lib/auth/config.ts`, `app/api/v1/users/invite/route.ts`) resolve through it.
  Changing an email kind's props is a versioned public-surface change. Vanilla
  Resparkable output is unchanged when no override is set. See
  [`CUSTOMIZATION.md`](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) §2 and §4. [#347]
- **Anonymous visitor observability — durable signed `visitorId` in server logs.**
  The proxy now issues a durable, HMAC-signed `resparkable_vid` cookie (HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Lax, Secure in production, 180-day TTL) and folds a `visitorId` into
  the log context alongside `requestId`, so an anonymous visitor's journey
  (page load → contact form → chat) can be correlated across requests for error
  reproduction — where the per-request `requestId` cannot. New public surface:
  the `LogContext.visitorId` field; `getVisitorId()` and the `visitorId` field
  on `getRequestContext()` / `getFullContext()` in `lib/logging/context.ts`; the
  `ChatRequest.visitorId` field threaded through `streamChat()`; the
  `lib/logging/visitor-id.ts` signing module; and two env flags — `LOG_VISITOR_ID`
  (default **on**, set `false` to disable) and `LOG_HTTP_ACCESS` (default **off**,
  opt-in per-request proxy access log). The signing key is derived from
  `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` via HKDF with domain separation; the cookie is
  tamper-verified and the proxy strips any spoofed inbound `x-visitor-id`
  header. The `visitorId` is pseudonymous and covered by log-retention windows,
  not the `eraseUser()` cascade. See
  [`.context/logging/visitor-tracing.md`](./.context/logging/visitor-tracing.md)
  and [`.context/privacy/visitor-id.md`](./.context/privacy/visitor-id.md). [#341]

### Added

- `AiAgent.runtimePromptManaged` (Boolean, default `false`) and
  `AiAgent.runtimePromptNote` (nullable String) — an advisory, behaviour-neutral
  honesty flag for agents dispatched for their provider/model binding only,
  whose system prompt is assembled in application code per call (the capability
  pattern) rather than read from the stored `persona` / `systemInstructions` /
  `guardrails` / `brandVoiceInstructions` fields. When set, the admin agent
  form's Instructions tab shows a non-dismissible callout and re-labels the
  "Effective prompt preview" as **not** what the LLM receives, so an operator
  isn't misled into tuning inert instruction fields. App-populated; round-trips
  through the agent create/GET/PATCH API and is captured in version snapshots.
  The runtime never reads it — no execution-path change. (#304)
- `runStructuredCompletion` (`lib/orchestration/evaluations/parse-structured.ts`)
  accepts optional `responseSchema` / `responseSchemaName` / `responseSchemaStrict`
  on `StructuredCompletionOptions`. When `responseSchema` is supplied it is
  forwarded as a `json_schema` `responseFormat` on both the first attempt and
  the temp-0 retry, so supporting providers enforce the output shape
  (OpenAI-compatible `response_format`; Anthropic forced-tool extraction)
  instead of relying on the prompt's prose alone. Purely additive — callers
  that don't opt in are unchanged, and providers without support ignore the
  field (the `parse` + retry path remains the cross-provider safety net). (#307)
- Streaming speech-to-text provider seam: optional `transcribeStream?()` on the
  `LlmProvider` interface (the streaming analogue of `transcribe()`), a new
  `TranscribeChunk` union (`partial` / `final` / `done` with `audioSeconds`) and
  `TranscribeAudio` type, and a `streamTranscription()` / `batchTranscribeAsStream()`
  helper (`lib/orchestration/llm/transcribe-stream.ts`) that prefers native
  streaming, falls back to adapting a batch `transcribe()` into a single
  `final` + `done` stream, and raises `ProviderError` `not_supported` when the
  provider can transcribe by neither path. Billed by `audioSeconds`, identical
  to the batch path. Platform seam only — the client transport and live
  `MicButton` mic layer remain a follow-up (the transport spike); the batch
  `transcribe()` path is unchanged and stays the default. (#308)

### Fixed

- Anthropic structured-output (forced-tool extraction) robustness on the
  `json_schema` `responseFormat` path: (1) the extraction tool name derived
  from `responseFormat.name` is now slugified + length-capped to satisfy
  Anthropic's `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$` tool-name rule (a name with spaces or
  over the cap previously 400'd on Anthropic only); (2) a `max_tokens`
  truncation during extraction now raises the actionable `truncated_no_output`
  error instead of degrading into a malformed-JSON parse failure (the partial
  tool input was non-empty content, so the prior empty-output guard missed it);
  (3) a non-object-rooted schema is now rejected with a clear `invalid_schema`
  error rather than being silently coerced to `object` and sent as an
  incoherent `input_schema`. Behaviour change: callers passing a non-object
  root schema to Anthropic now get a local error (previously a provider-side
  failure). (#335)
- Agent export/import bundle now round-trips the full agent configuration.
  Previously the bundle silently dropped many `AiAgent` fields on export/import
  (`kind`, `persona`, `guardrails`, `personaMode`/`voiceMode`/`guardrailsMode`,
  `knowledgeAccessMode`/`knowledgeRetrievalMode`/`knowledgeTriggerKeywords`,
  `enableVoiceInput`/`enableImageInput`/`enableDocumentInput`,
  `runtimePromptManaged`/`runtimePromptNote`) and never wrote `maxCostPerTurnUsd`
  on import. The bundle now also carries the linked **profile** and granted
  **knowledge tags** by slug and re-links them on import; a referenced profile
  or tag missing in the target environment fails the import with an actionable
  message (rather than silently dropping the agent's identity / knowledge
  scoping). Agent→document grants are intentionally still not carried —
  documents lack a stable cross-environment key (tracked in #338). Older bundles
  remain importable (all new fields are optional/defaulted). (#332)

### Added

- **App-extensible database drift-probe seam — `lib/app/db-drift.ts`** (issue
  #284). A new auto-wired `lib/app/*` seam exporting `registerAppDriftProbes()`,
  so a fork can register its **own** Prisma-unmodelled DB objects (hand-written
  FK constraints, custom indexes, CHECK constraints) and have
  `npm run db:drift-check` (CI + `/pre-pr`) probe them alongside Resparkable's
  A-series — without editing the platform-owned `scripts/db/check-drift.ts`. New
  module `lib/db/drift-probes.ts` exposes the probe primitives (`indexExists`,
  `constraintExists`, `columnExists`) and registry (`registerAppDriftProbe`,
  `getAppDriftProbes`, `mergeDriftProbes`). `constraintExists`'s optional
  definition-substring argument is the documented home for a manual-FK `onDelete`
  policy (assert `ON DELETE CASCADE`/`SET NULL`), which the schema-level
  `onDelete` rule can't see. Registering a duplicate name, or one that shadows an
  A-series probe, throws. See `CUSTOMIZATION.md` §5 and
  `.context/database/prisma-unmodelled-objects.md`.
- **`AccountType` enum + `User.accountType` field** (`HUMAN` | `SERVICE`,
  default `HUMAN`) — a first-class axis, orthogonal to `role`, distinguishing
  real login users from non-login machine/system principals (the seeded
  config-owner). Migration `20260531115829_add_account_type`. New shared
  predicates `humanWhere` / `humanAdminWhere` / `serviceAccountWhere` in
  `lib/auth/account.ts` — the single source of truth every admin
  count/list/guard uses to exclude SERVICE principals.
- **`AuthBootstrap` Prisma model** (`auth_bootstrap` table) — a singleton marker
  recording that the one-time first-user-is-admin bootstrap has completed.
  Migration `20260531100706_add_auth_bootstrap`. New export: `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ID`
  from `lib/auth/constants.ts`.
- **`prisma/seeds/019-reconcile-legacy-seed-users.ts`** — one-time, idempotent
  upgrade reconciliation for databases seeded under v0.0.1: erases the legacy
  credential-less `admin@example.com` / `test@example.com` artifacts (preserving
  real users), re-points orphaned config ownership to the SERVICE owner, and
  marks the bootstrap complete on established instances.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` brand seam** (issue #305) — a single optional env var
  renames the app's display name across page-title metadata (root + route-group
  layouts and the auth pages) and the email templates, with no file edits.
  Consumed via the new `lib/brand.ts` (`BRAND.name`), which reads
  `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` directly so it is safe on both server and
  client; registered in `lib/env.ts` and `.env.example`. Defaults to `"Resparkable"`
  — unset leaves every surface byte-for-byte unchanged. Marketing-page body copy
  is intentionally out of scope (a separate content concern); `RESPARKABLE_VERSION`
  and internal platform identifiers deliberately do not use this seam.

### Changed

- **Auth bootstrap — first account on a fresh database becomes `ADMIN`.**
  `userCreateBeforeHook` (`lib/auth/config.ts`) promotes the first real account
  created on an empty database (email/password **or** OAuth) to `ADMIN`; every
  subsequent account is a regular `USER`. The promotion is one-time (gated on the
  `AuthBootstrap` marker, self-healing if a write is missed) and fails open — a
  DB error in the check never blocks signup. The seed unit formerly at
  `prisma/seeds/001-test-users.ts` is renamed to
  `prisma/seeds/001-system-owner.ts` and provisions a single non-login
  `system@resparkable.local` config-owner (`role: ADMIN`, `accountType: SERVICE`, no
  credential) instead of the login-able `admin@example.com` / `test@example.com`
  users. New export: `SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` from `lib/auth/constants.ts`.
- **Orchestration seeds resolve the config owner deterministically** via
  `serviceAccountWhere` (the SERVICE account) rather than the first `ADMIN` row.

### Fixed

- **`PATCH /api/v1/admin/orchestration/settings` now accepts DB-managed model
  ids in `defaultModels`** (issue #302, Bug A). The handler hydrates the
  in-memory model registry from the `AiProviderModel` matrix before validating,
  so a discovery-added model (e.g. a date-stamped `gpt-5.5-pro-2026-04-23` that
  exists only in the DB, not the static registry) that the settings form offers
  in its dropdown is no longer rejected on save with `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400).
  Mirrors the other model-id paths (workflow execute, cost estimation) that
  already hydrate first.
- **`AiConversation` inbound unique key no longer triggers a phantom
  `ALTER INDEX ... RENAME` on every `prisma migrate dev`** (issue #283). The
  `@@unique([agentId, channel, fromAddress])` now pins its DB name with
  `map: "ai_conversation_inbound_key"`; Prisma 7's `migrate diff` ignored the
  `name:` argument for the DB object and re-derived the default name, injecting
  a spurious rename into every fork's generated migration. The Client-API
  compound key (`name:`) is unchanged, and existing deployed databases diff
  clean (no migration required).
- **Model discovery no longer mis-tiers date-stamped frontier models** (issue
  #302, Bug B). The name heuristics in `lib/orchestration/llm/model-heuristics.ts`
  now strip a trailing date stamp (`gpt-5.5-pro-2026-04-23`,
  `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) before classifying, and recognise the flagship
  suffixes `pro` / `ultra` / `max` as frontier signals alongside `opus` and the
  o-series. A frontier "pro" model surfaced by discovery is now suggested as the
  `thinking` tier (→ `frontier` display) instead of falling through to
  `infrastructure` (→ `budget`). New export `stripModelDateStamp` from the same
  module. Operator review/override of a suggested tier is unchanged.
- **Knowledge document parsers no longer crash in a production build** (issues
  #315, #320). HTML and PDF ingestion threw only in the bundled production server
  (`next build && next start`) — invisible under `npm run dev` — so **any**
  production deployment (not just Vercel, where it first surfaced) returned a 500
  when ingesting those formats. Two independent bundling causes: jsdom ≥27's ESM
  `@exodus/bytes` fails to load under Next's production `require` path (pinned to
  `jsdom@^26`, with a Dependabot ignore for ≥27), and `pdf-parse` expects canvas
  globals (`DOMMatrix` et al.) that aren't present in the server bundle (now
  polyfilled). Parsers are also lazy-imported so a fork that doesn't ingest those
  formats never loads the browser-coupled deps.

### Security

- **Removed the documented-but-nonfunctional default seed credentials.** The
  README previously advertised `admin@example.com` / `test@example.com` with
  `password123`, but the seed never created the better-auth credential records,
  so those logins never worked. Resparkable now ships **zero default login
  credentials**; admin access is bootstrapped by the first-signup rule above.
- **Closed an admin re-bootstrap privilege-escalation window and related
  miscounts.** "Real human admin" is now a single predicate (`accountType:
  'HUMAN'`) routed through every admin count/list/guard — the last-admin
  self-delete guard, the bootstrap human-count, the admin dashboard stats, and
  the admin user list — so the non-login SERVICE config-owner can never be
  miscounted as an operator (which previously let the last human admin
  self-delete to zero and re-open the bootstrap). The SERVICE account is also
  immutable via the user-management API (`CANNOT_MODIFY_SYSTEM_ACCOUNT` /
  `CANNOT_DELETE_SYSTEM_ACCOUNT`), the bootstrap is gated on the persisted
  `AuthBootstrap` marker, and `SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` is reserved at signup.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-30

> **Alpha release.** First tagged Resparkable release. Ships in `0.x` per
> [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#0x-alpha-semantics--loose-by-design) —
> forks adopting this release should expect real merge work between any two
> `0.x` releases. The strict SemVer contract activates at `1.0.0`.

The entries below are the fork-readiness pass — the work that makes
Resparkable safe to fork and to merge upstream releases into.

### Added

- **Versioning infrastructure** — `lib/resparkable-version.ts` (`RESPARKABLE_VERSION`
  constant), `lib/app-version.ts` (`APP_VERSION` — the fork-owned counterpart
  derived from `package.json.version` via a direct import, eliminating the
  brittle `process.env.npm_package_version` detour), `VERSIONING.md`
  (public-surface contract), this `CHANGELOG.md`, and a `resparkable` field on
  the public `/api/health` response so any deployment exposes which Resparkable
  it's running. Includes `lib/validations/monitoring.ts` (Zod schema for
  runtime validation of the health-response shape at the client boundary).
- **Fork-extension seams** (the registries batch) — auto-wired `lib/app/`
  surface for forks to register their own capabilities, admin nav sections,
  rate-limit tiers/rules, and environment variables without touching platform
  code. Includes an ESLint app-boundary that keeps `lib/app/**` portable.
- **GDPR data erasure** — `eraseUser()` service with cascade / `SetNull`
  policies on every `User` FK, a last-admin guard, and an erasure-hook
  registry for app-side residual cleanup that the schema-level cascade can't
  reach (`lib/privacy/erasure-hooks.ts`). The seed of the full data-erasure
  pattern; see [`.context/privacy/data-erasure.md`](./.context/privacy/data-erasure.md).
- **Multi-tenancy playbook** — opt-in playbook with a `TENANCY_MODE`
  environment seam and an inert `lib/tenancy/client.ts` so a fork can retrofit
  Postgres RLS without forking the platform. Resparkable stays single-tenant by
  default. See [`.context/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](./.context/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Public fork-onboarding guide** — `CUSTOMIZATION.md` at repo root, covering
  the app/platform model, the `lib/app/` extension surface, the `package.json`
  dependency/script policy, the database-schema split (your models go in
  `prisma/schema/app.prisma`), and the upstream-sync recipe.
- **Schema-folder split** — Prisma schema split into domain files under
  `prisma/schema/`, with `prisma/schema/app.prisma` reserved for fork-owned
  models. Keeps platform vs app models visually separable on every diff.
- **Migration baseline squash** — 106 dev-history migrations folded into a
  single fork-ready `prisma/migrations/` baseline. Forks adopting this
  release inherit a clean, reviewable migration history rather than the full
  pre-fork churn. See `.context/database/migrations.md` for the reconciliation
  recipe and `npm run db:drift-check` for the drift-detection tooling.
- **Capability quarantine / emergency-disable** — admin orchestration API
  surface for disabling a misbehaving capability without redeploying or
  unbinding it from agents. Includes quarantine-attribution metadata, a
  quarantined-capabilities banner on affected agent pages, and an active-
  quarantines dashboard panel under `/admin/orchestration`. See the
  orchestration admin API reference and `.context/admin/orchestration.md`.
- **Orchestration admin list endpoints — pagination, search, sort** —
  admin list endpoints under `/api/v1/admin/orchestration/**` (agents,
  knowledge documents) now accept paged/search/sorted query parameters,
  with corresponding admin tables wired to use them. Reduces the
  rehydration cost for forks running large agent/knowledge inventories.
- **Agent profiles** — shared persona / voice / guardrails library that
  multiple agents can attach, with override / append composition modes
  resolved at runtime. See `.context/admin/orchestration-agent-profiles.md`
  (admin UI) and `.context/orchestration/agent-profiles.md` (resolver).

### Changed

- **Rate limiting is middleware-driven.** Section caps for `/api/v1/**` are
  enforced by `proxy.ts` via the policy table at
  `lib/security/rate-limit-policy.ts` — new routes inherit the `api` cap
  automatically. Per-flow sub-caps (chat-stream, audio, upload, etc.) remain
  in the handlers. See [`.context/security/rate-limiting.md`](./.context/security/rate-limiting.md).
- **Knowledge-base default seeding is self-healing.** `npm run db:seed`
  re-derives the `kb_default` row when missing rather than failing fast on a
  pre-existing database that's lost the seed — relevant for forks pulling the
  squashed baseline into an existing dev environment.
