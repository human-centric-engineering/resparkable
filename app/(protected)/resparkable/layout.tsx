/**
 * The Resparkable shell.
 *
 * ## Three things are always on screen, on purpose
 *
 * **Capture**, because a thought you had while looking at the projects list has to
 * land from there or it doesn't land at all — the inbox is the front door of this
 * product and the whole thing is worth only as much as capture is frictionless.
 * It is a fixed, full-height drawer rather than a column in this grid: the panel
 * overlays the page instead of narrowing it, so the board and the graph get their
 * full width back and the capture box gets room to think in. See
 * `resparkable-sidekick.tsx`.
 *
 * **Search**, because "where did I write that" is the question a second brain
 * exists to answer, and making it a destination rather than a field means people
 * stop asking.
 *
 * **The section nav with counts**, because unreviewed work that is invisible is
 * unreviewed work that stays unreviewed. It is a rail down the left rather than a
 * row across the top — see `resparkable-nav.tsx` for why fourteen pills on two rows
 * had to go.
 *
 * ## Why there is no longer an "Resparkable" title block
 *
 * There were three titles above the first card: the app nav said Resparkable, an h1
 * said Resparkable, and the section header said Inbox. Two of them said the same
 * thing, and the product tagline under the h1 ("everything you've captured…")
 * said roughly what the Inbox blurb underneath it said, one line later. The page
 * now names itself once — the section, which is the thing that changes — and the
 * word Resparkable survives in the rail head, where it is also the way home.
 *
 * ## Why the counts are fetched here and not in the pages
 *
 * The nav lives in the layout, so the numbers have to be resolved here — a page
 * cannot pass props up. `/resparkable/counts` exists for exactly this: three indexed
 * counts, ETag'd, rather than re-reading the eleven-query `/today` payload on
 * every surface.
 *
 * A failure returns no counts rather than no page. Badges are an affordance; the
 * brain still works without them, and a layout that 500s over a decoration would
 * take out twelve pages.
