/**
 * The chat surface.
 *
 * ## The one surface with no server read
 *
 * Every other page in the tier fetches its payload server-side and hands it to a
 * client child (`ui.md` rule 2). This one has nothing to fetch: the transcript
 * lives in the stream, and the orientation an agent needs — goals, projects, top
 * tasks, capacity — is injected server-side as the `resparkable` context block on
 * every turn. Fetching a snapshot here to render *around* the chat would show
 * the person a second, staler copy of what the agent is already reading.
 *
 * ## Why the agent slug comes from a constant
 *
 * `RESPARKABLE_AGENT_SLUGS.companion`, not a picker. The other four agents hold
 * write capabilities and are meant to be driven by scheduled workflows; the
 * route enforces that against `RESPARKABLE_CHAT_AGENT_SLUGS`, and a page that
 * offered them would be offering something the API refuses.
