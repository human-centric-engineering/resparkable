/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/transcribe — speech to text for the capture box.
 *
 * ## Why Resparkable owns a transcribe route
 *
 * The platform ships one at `/api/v1/admin/orchestration/chat/transcribe` and it
 * is `withAdminAuth` — the same reason Resparkable owns its chat stream. A personal
 * second brain whose microphone needs an admin session is not a product.
 *
 * Everything below the auth line is the platform's, imported rather than
 * re-derived: the multipart validation (`validateTranscribeUpload`), the provider
 * resolution (`getAudioProvider`) and the cost log. This route is the thin
 * consumer-side wrapper around them.
 *
 * ## What it gates on, and what it deliberately doesn't
 *
 * **The org-wide kill switch, yes.** `voiceInputGloballyEnabled` is an operator's
 * "no microphones on this instance" and it has to mean that everywhere.
 *
 * **The per-agent `enableVoiceInput` flag, no.** That flag governs the mic on an
 * agent's *chat* surface — whose audio becomes a turn in a conversation with that
 * agent. This microphone is attached to the capture box: the transcript lands in
 * a textarea the user then edits and saves as their own note, and no agent is
 * addressed at any point. Gating it on a chat-surface flag would make voice
 * capture depend on a setting that has nothing to do with it, and default it off
 * for every install (`enableVoiceInput` is `@default(false)`).
 *
 * The companion agent is still resolved, but only so the cost row is attributable
 * to something — voice capture that appears in the cost report as an orphan is
 * spend nobody can explain later.
 *
 * ## The audio is not persisted
 *
 * Same invariant as the admin route: bytes go to the provider and are dropped.
 * The only write on the happy path is `logCost`.
 *
 * Rate limiting: `resparkable-audio`, 10/min keyed on the session user, registered in
 * `lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts` and applied by `proxy.ts`.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
