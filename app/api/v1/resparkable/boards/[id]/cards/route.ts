/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/boards/[id]/cards — pin a task to an explicit board.
 *
 * ## The client sends an index, not a position
 *
 * A drag knows where the card landed in the visual order. Turning that into a
 * fractional position — and spotting when the gap has collapsed and the column needs
 * spreading back out — is arithmetic with a failure mode nobody would notice: two
 * cards silently sharing a position, after which the column's order changes between
 * reads. Every client would have to reimplement it, and would get that one case
 * wrong. So the server owns it (`services/fractional-position.ts`).
 *
 * ## Explicit boards only
 *
 * A filter-backed board's membership *is* its query, and its order is
 * `priorityScore`. Pinning a card to one would create a position that nothing reads
 * and imply a hand-ordering the board does not have — so it is a 400, not a silent
 * no-op (§12: the two ordering mechanisms never apply to the same board).
 *
 * Authentication: required.
