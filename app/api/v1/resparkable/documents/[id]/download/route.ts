/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/documents/[id]/download — a short-lived link to the original.
 *
 * This route only ever returns a **signed URL**, never the stored URL and never
 * the bytes. The reason is worth spelling out, because "just return
 * `result.url`" looks equivalent and is not: on some providers that URL is
 * publicly fetchable forever by anyone who has it, so persisting or returning it
 * turns a private document into a permanent public link.
 *
 * Three ways this legitimately 404s, all reported identically to a missing id:
 *
 *   - the deployment discards originals (`documentOriginals: 'discard'`, default);
 *   - the provider cannot store privately or cannot sign URLs
 *     (`canServeRetainedOriginals()` — Vercel Blob today);
 *   - the document has no original because retention failed or was off when it
 *     was uploaded.
 *
 * A 404 rather than a 501 in the provider cases: from the caller's point of view
 * there is no downloadable original here, and the distinction between "never
 * stored" and "cannot be served" is an operator concern, surfaced on the admin
 * settings page where it can be acted on.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
