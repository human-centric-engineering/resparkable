/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/connections — the review queue, with both ends resolved.
 *
 * `/resparkable/links` returns rows as stored: four opaque strings per link, because the
 * edge table is polymorphic and has no FKs to its endpoints (D2). This endpoint
 * hydrates both ends, one query per distinct type across the page, so a review UI can
 * name the two things it is asking about. `/links` stays the raw CRUD surface.
 *
 * With no `?status`, the queue shows what is waiting on a decision — suggested and
 * proposed. Rejected rows are tombstones that stop the sweep re-proposing a pair
 * (§17 risk 5c) and are reachable only by asking for them explicitly.
 *
 * Not ETag'd: reviewing changes the list on nearly every request, so a conditional
 * GET would almost never hit.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
