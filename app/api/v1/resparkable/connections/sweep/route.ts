/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/connections/sweep — hunt for new connections now.
 *
 * The sweep normally runs on a schedule (phase 7's `resparkable-connection-finder`).
 * This is the on-demand door: the Connections view's "look again" button, and the
 * path the verification script drives.
 *
 * It costs **no embedding tokens** — it reads vectors that are already stored and
 * does neighbour search in SQL (D4). What it does cost is a few hundred indexed
 * queries, hence the 5/hour sub-cap.
 *
 * The response reports `cappedTypes` when the per-type source cap bit. That is
 * deliberate: a sweep that quietly examined 200 of 900 projects reads as "no more
 * connections exist" when it means "we stopped looking".
 *
 * Authentication: required.
