/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/reindex — run a bounded indexing pass.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *
 *   - default: process what is already queued (rows whose `indexedHash` is null).
 *   - `force: true`: queue **every** live row first. This is the "the active
 *     embedding model changed" path and is the most expensive thing a user can
 *     trigger, which is why it is opt-in and why the response reports what it
 *     queued rather than just succeeding quietly.
 *
 * The pass is bounded per type and returns counts including `remaining`, so a
 * caller with a large backlog polls this rather than waiting on one long request.
 * `unchanged` in the response is the interesting number: those are rows examined
 * for free because their content hash still matched.
 *
 * Rate limiting: 5/hour sub-cap, registered in `lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts`.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
