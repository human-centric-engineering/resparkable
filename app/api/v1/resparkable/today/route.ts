/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/today — the dashboard's only fetch.
 *
 * Ranked tasks with their project and area, today's time blocks, the inbox
 * count, goals at risk, unreviewed connections, the latest review and this
 * week's remaining capacity — in one round trip, with a fixed number of queries
 * behind it however many tasks there are.
 *
 * ETag'd because this is the endpoint a dashboard polls: most of the time the
 * answer has not changed, and a 304 costs a hash instead of a payload.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
