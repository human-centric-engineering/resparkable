/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/snapshot — the whole brain, small enough for a prompt.
 *
 * The HTTP face of what `resparkable_get_snapshot` returns and what phase 6c's chat
 * context contributor renders. Exposed as a route because every Resparkable
 * capability must be reachable over HTTP too (CLAUDE.md is API-first): one
 * implementation, exercised by the web UI, the agent layer and MCP alike, so a
 * change to what "the state of my brain" means cannot land in one and not the
 * others.
 *
 * ETag'd like `/today` — the shape moves slowly, and a poller should pay a hash
 * rather than a payload.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
