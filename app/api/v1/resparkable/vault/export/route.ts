/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/vault/export — the whole brain as an Obsidian vault.
 *
 * Returns a **zip, not JSON**. This is the one Resparkable endpoint whose body is a
 * file, and it is deliberate: the answer to *"what happens to my data if I stop
 * using this?"* has to be a thing you can open, not a payload that needs a
 * second tool to become readable.
 *
 * The archive is an export **and** a starter vault — folder skeleton, README
 * describing the frontmatter contract, and a minimal `.obsidian/` — so a
 * brand-new user's export already opens in Obsidian. One code path, so there is
 * no second thing to keep true (`vault/export.ts`).
 *
 * Not ETag'd, unlike the other whole-brain read (`/snapshot`). A conditional GET
 * would mean building the entire archive to hash it, which is the expensive part;
 * and a download is a deliberate one-off, not something a client polls.
 *
 * Rate limiting: 10/hour sub-cap (`lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts`) — this
 * reads every table the brain has.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
