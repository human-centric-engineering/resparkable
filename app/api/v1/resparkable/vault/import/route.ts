/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/vault/import — read an Obsidian vault back in.
 *
 * Multipart, one `file` field holding a zip of the vault folder, plus two flags.
 *
 * ## Dry-run is the default and the flags are opt-in
 *
 * Without `apply=true` this computes the full plan and writes nothing, returning
 * a per-file diff the UI renders before anyone commits to it. That is free — the
 * plan is computed either way — and it is what §14 asks for as the first line of
 * blast-radius control. `allowBlanking=true` is the second: a file whose body has
 * gone missing will not silently wipe a note's prose unless somebody says so.
 *
 * ## What this route does not do
 *
 * It never deletes. A row absent from the archive is left alone — deletion is the
 * one unrecoverable operation and deleting a file in Obsidian is one keystroke.
 *
 * ## Guard order matters
 *
 * `enforceContentLengthCap` runs **before** `request.formData()`, exactly as the
 * document upload route does and for the same reason: `formData()` materialises
 * the whole body in memory, so checking afterwards means having already accepted
 * whatever was sent. The decompression caps then run inside `readVaultZip`,
 * before any entry is inflated.
 *
 * Rate limiting: 10/hour sub-cap (`lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts`).
 *
 * Authentication: required.
