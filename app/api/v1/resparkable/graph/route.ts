/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/graph — a neighbourhood around one node.
 *
 * `focus` and `focusType` are required. There is deliberately no "show everything"
 * mode: above a few hundred nodes a personal graph is a hairball that looks
 * impressive and says nothing (§9), and the cost of building one is paid in the
 * database before any client could decide to ignore it.
 *
 * The walk is breadth-first with a node cap, and `truncated` reports whether it
 * stopped at the cap or ran out of connections — those look identical on screen and
 * mean opposite things. Archived items are absent because their embeddings are
 * deleted on archive (§17 risk 5b), so they are not part of the semantic layer at
 * all; rejected links are absent because a dismissal is not a connection.
 *
 * Costs no embedding tokens — it reads stored links and summaries only, so the
 * section rate-limit cap is the right level of protection and no sub-cap is needed.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
