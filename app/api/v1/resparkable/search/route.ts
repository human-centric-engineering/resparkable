/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/search — hybrid search across the owner's brain.
 *
 * One query, three passes (semantic over vectors, tsvector over tasks, and — only
 * when `includeArchived=true` — substring over the archived corpus, which by
 * design has no vectors). See `lib/framework/resparkable/search/hybrid-search.ts`.
 *
 * Rate limiting: `/api/v1/**` inherits the 100/min section cap from `proxy.ts`,
 * and Resparkable registers a tighter 30/min sub-cap for this path because every
 * request embeds the query — one paid API call each (`lib/framework/resparkable/
 * rate-limit.ts`). Nothing to call here; the middleware already did.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** ETag'd, unlike `/today`. A search response is keyed by a
 * free-text query, so cache hits would be rare, and the expensive half (the
 * embedding call) happens before we could compute a tag to compare.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
