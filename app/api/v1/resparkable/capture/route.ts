/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/capture — the front door.
 *
 * A narrower door than `POST /resparkable/thoughts`, and idempotent where that one
 * is not exposed to be. Everything that captures — the quick-capture box, a
 * share sheet, an iOS Shortcut, inbound email, an agent mid-conversation —
 * comes through here, so every field this endpoint does *not* accept is a field
 * none of them can get wrong.
 *
 * **`externalId` is what makes a retry safe.** A phone on a flaky connection, a
 * redelivered Postmark webhook and a double-tapped Shortcut button all send the
 * same thing twice. With an `externalId` the second one returns the first one's
 * row and reports `deduped: true`, rather than creating a second inbox item or
 * failing with a 409. Losing a captured thought is the one unforgivable failure
 * in this product; quietly duplicating one is the second.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
