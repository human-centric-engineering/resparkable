/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/tasks/[id]/view — one task, with its context.
 *
 * The task, its project and area, the goal it serves where there is one, and its
 * connections. Feeds the card detail sheet, which otherwise would fetch a project,
 * an area, a goal and a link list separately every time a card was opened.
 *
 * `goalTitle` is only the direct project → goal link, and only an accepted one. The
 * scorer walks further than that, but a detail sheet presenting a multi-hop
 * inference as "this serves X" would assert more than it knows.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
