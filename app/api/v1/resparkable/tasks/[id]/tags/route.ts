/**
 * PUT /api/v1/resparkable/tasks/[id]/tags — set a task's labels.
 *
 * **Replace semantics, not a delta**: the body carries the whole set, because a board
 * UI thinks in terms of "these are the labels now". Exposing add and remove
 * separately would make the client compute the difference, and a half-applied
 * difference — the add landed, the remove didn't — is a state nobody would notice
 * until a label reappeared.
 *
 * It was `PATCH` until resparkable#495 (ask #18) landed `apiClient.put()`. The
 * behaviour never differed — the verb did, and only because Resparkable's client
 * exposed get/post/patch/delete and adding one would have been an edit to a
 * Resparkable-owned file. Now that the verb exists, the route says what it means:
 * whole-resource replacement.
 *
 * The repo applies it as one transaction, and silently drops tag ids the caller does
 * not own rather than erroring: a stale board tab whose tag was deleted in another
 * window should save the rest, not fail outright.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
