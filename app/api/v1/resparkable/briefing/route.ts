/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/briefing — today's briefing, instantly.
 *
 * **This route makes no LLM call, and that is its entire specification.**
 * `plan.md` §6 is emphatic: waiting twenty seconds after pressing a button is a
 * bad experience, and the inputs barely change between 3am and 8am. The nightly
 * `resparkable-morning-briefing` workflow writes the briefing; this serves the
 * stored row.
 *
 * `stale` is what stops that being a lie. If the overnight run did not happen,
 * the stored briefing is from an earlier day — and a planner that presents
 * yesterday's plan as this morning's is worse than one that admits it has
 * nothing. The UI shows the generated-at time for the same reason.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
