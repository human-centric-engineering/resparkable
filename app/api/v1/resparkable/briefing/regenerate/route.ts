/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/briefing/regenerate — write a new briefing.
 *
 * **The button on Today does not come here.** That reads the stored row through
 * `GET /resparkable/briefing` and is instant. This exists for the two cases §6 names:
 * the overnight run did not happen, or the person explicitly asked for something
 * different today ("surprise me").
 *
 * It **queues** rather than runs. `queueResparkableWorkflowRun` writes a `PENDING`
 * execution and the maintenance tick picks it up, which is the platform's own
 * async path — the alternative is re-implementing the scheduler's version
 * resolution, lease handling and budget resolution inside a route handler, where
 * it would quietly drift from the real one. The trade is latency, and the whole
 * reason the briefing is pre-computed overnight is that nobody should be waiting
 * on this path anyway.
 *
 * `workStyleOverride` is the "surprise me today" control. It changes this run
 * only and never writes the stored setting, because people are structured in a
 * deadline week and exploratory on a quiet Friday — a setting that could not be
 * overridden would become a cage.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
