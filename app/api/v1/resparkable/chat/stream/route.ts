/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/chat/stream — the app-owned chat surface (SSE).
 *
 * ## Why Resparkable owns a chat route at all
 *
 * The platform ships two, and neither fits (plan §5):
 *
 *   - `/api/v1/chat/stream` deliberately **drops `contextType` / `contextId`** —
 *     they are admin-only concepts there. Those two fields are exactly what the
 *     "always knows my goals" block travels on, so the consumer route gives an
 *     agent with tools and no idea who it is talking to.
 *   - `/api/v1/admin/orchestration/chat/stream` carries them, and requires
 *     `withAdminAuth`. A personal second brain whose chat needs an admin session
 *     is not a product.
 *
 * So: `withAuth`, `streamChat` directly, and both context fields pinned here.
 *
 * ## The two things pinned server-side
 *
 * **`contextId` is `session.user.id`, never client-supplied.** `buildContext`
 * caches on `type:id:userId`, and the Resparkable loader ignores `id` and reads
 * `request.userId` for exactly this reason — but defence in depth is cheap and a
 * body field named `contextId` is the obvious thing for a later change to start
 * honouring.
 *
 * **`agentSlug` is checked against `RESPARKABLE_CHAT_AGENT_SLUGS`.** That list is a
 * security boundary, not a UI convenience: `resparkable-triage` and
 * `resparkable-strategist` hold write capabilities and are meant to be driven by
 * scheduled workflows, where their input is the user's own data. Letting a
 * browser drive them would hand a prompt-injected document a write path tuned
 * with a different guard profile than the companion's. `streamChat` itself does
 * **not** gate on `AiAgent.visibility` — confirmed in the handler — which is
 * what lets `resparkable-companion` stay `internal`, and is also why the check has
 * to happen here.
 *
 * ## `entityContext`
 *
 * Forwarded verbatim into `CapabilityContext` when a "tell me more" chat is
 * opened from an Area/Goal/Project page — this route does not trust the id it
 * carries, only bounds its shape (`resparkableEntityContextSchema`). The
 * capability that reads it (`resparkable_capture_context`) re-verifies
 * ownership before acting, the same way `resparkable_link_entities` already
 * does for a hand-made link.
 *
 * ## Rate limiting
 *
 * `resparkable-chat`, 20/min keyed on the session user, registered in
 * `lib/framework/resparkable/rate-limit.ts` and applied by `proxy.ts` before this
 * handler runs. Per CLAUDE.md the handler does not call a section limiter itself.
 * The per-turn *spend* ceiling is separate and lives on the agent row.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
