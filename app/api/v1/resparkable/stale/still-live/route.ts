/**
 * POST /api/v1/resparkable/stale/still-live — "yes, this is still live."
 *
 * One of the three answers a stale-digest row offers. The other two already have
 * routes: *archive* is `PATCH`/`DELETE` on the item's own resource, and *drop*
 * is a status change through the same. Only this one needed an endpoint, because
 * "I looked at this and it is fine" is not otherwise expressible.
 *
 * It writes `lastActivityAt = now`, which §11 calls the honest implementation
 * and it is: the user *did* just engage with the thing. That is what stops the
 * row reappearing next month, without a second "dismissed until" column that
 * would have to be kept in step with the first.
 *
 * A row that is not the caller's is a 404, never a 403 — the tier's rule
 * everywhere, because a 403 confirms the row exists.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
