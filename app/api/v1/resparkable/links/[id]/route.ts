/**
 * PATCH /api/v1/resparkable/links/[id] — review a suggested connection.
 *
 * Accept it, reject it, or snooze it. **There is no DELETE**, and that is the
 * point: rejecting sets `status: 'rejected'`, which is a tombstone. The sweep
 * excludes any pair that already has a link row, so the rejected row is the only
 * thing stopping the same suggestion reappearing every single run, forever (§17
 * risk 5c — and the schema comments say so at the column, because someone will
 * eventually try to clean these up).
 *
 * `strength` is not patchable: it is the measured cosine similarity that produced
 * the suggestion, and letting a review edit it would make the number mean two
 * different things depending on who wrote it.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
