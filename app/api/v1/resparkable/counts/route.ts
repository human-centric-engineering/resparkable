/**
 * GET /api/v1/resparkable/counts — the shell's badge numbers.
 *
 * Three indexed counts: un-triaged inbox thoughts, unreviewed connection
 * suggestions, open tasks. The Resparkable layout renders on every surface and needs
 * these everywhere; see `lib/framework/resparkable/services/counts.ts` for why this
 * is a separate endpoint rather than a second read of `/today`.
 *
 * ETag'd, because this is fetched on every navigation and the answer is usually
 * the same three numbers as last time — a 304 costs a hash instead of a payload.
 *
 * Authentication: required.
