          <h2>What this is</h2>
          <p>
            {BRAND.name} is a system for capturing ideas and keeping them alongside your notes,
            tasks, projects and goals. It is actively developed, and features are added and improved
            over time.
          </p>

          <h2>What you keep</h2>
          <p>
            Everything you write stays yours. Nothing here transfers ownership of your content, and
            nothing gives anyone permission to use it for any purpose other than running the service
            for you. Your content is not used to train models and is not sold. You can take it all
            out as a folder of markdown at any time, and you can delete it.
          </p>

          <h2>Using it sensibly</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>One account per person; keep your credentials to yourself.</li>
            <li>Do not use it to store or transmit anything unlawful.</li>
            <li>
              Do not attempt to reach another account&apos;s data, or to work around the rate limits
              that keep the service available to everyone.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The assistant</h2>
          <p>
            Parts of the system use language models. Their output can be wrong, and the ranking,
            suggestions and summaries they produce are a starting point rather than advice. Do not
            rely on them for anything with a consequence you would not accept being wrong.
          </p>

          <h2>No warranty</h2>
          <p>
            The service is provided as it stands, without warranty of any kind. It may be
            unavailable, it may lose data, and it may change. Keep your own copy of anything you
            cannot afford to lose. The markdown export exists for exactly this.
          </p>

          <h2>Ending it</h2>
          <p>
            You can delete your account at any time from settings, which removes what is attached to
            it. An account may be closed if it is being used for something unlawful or something
            that degrades the service for others.
          </p>

          <h2>Questions</h2>
          <p>
            Ask through the <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link>.
