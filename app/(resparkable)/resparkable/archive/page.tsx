/**
 * The lifecycle surface: what has gone quiet, and what is already archived.
 *
 * ## Why the two live on one page
 *
 * They are the same story at two stages. The digest asks "is this still live?";
 * the archive holds what the answer was no to — plus everything retention aged
 * out on its own. Splitting them would leave two pages neither of which anyone
 * has a reason to visit, and the digest's most useful moment is exactly when
 * someone has come to tidy up.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in the main nav
 *
 * §11 is explicit that the archived list views and `?includeArchived=true` are
 * the only two ways to reach archived items. A permanent nav link to your own
 * archive puts the things you decided to stop thinking about back in front of
 * you every day, which is the opposite of what archiving is for. It is linked
 * from Settings and from the monthly review — both places you go on purpose.
 *
 * ## One fetch per section, none per row
 *
 * Six requests, fixed, whatever the archive holds. `includeArchived=only` is
 * what makes this an archive rather than a longer list: `true` would mix the
 * archived rows in among everything still live.
