# Resparkable — an agentic second brain

Capture thoughts as they happen, keep track of projects and goals across week / month / year / life horizons, and let background agents surface the connections between them.

Resparkable is a **framework-tier module built on [Sunrise](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise)** — designed to be installed into other Sunrise-based projects, not just this one. Everything Resparkable owns lives under the reserved `/framework` tier (`lib/framework/resparkable/`, `prisma/schema/framework-resparkable.prisma`, `framework_resparkable_*` tables, `.context/framework/resparkable/`), so Sunrise upgrades merge cleanly underneath it.

**Status: planning.** No Resparkable code has been written yet. The full implementation plan — data model, agents, workflows, sharing, boards, Obsidian sync, and a four-release delivery sequence — is at [`.context/framework/resparkable/plan.md`](./.context/framework/resparkable/plan.md).

## Staying current with Resparkable

This repository is a clone of Resparkable with full history, not a GitHub fork — so its visibility can be changed at any time. Resparkable is wired as `upstream`:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Pushing to `upstream` is disabled locally. To contribute a change back to Resparkable, push a branch to the Resparkable repository directly and open a PR there.

# Resparkable — the platform underneath

Everything below documents the Sunrise template Resparkable is built on.

## Why Resparkable?

- **Production-ready from day one** — Auth, database, APIs, security headers, rate limiting all configured
- **Agent-ready** — Production AI agent orchestration: agents, tools, workflows, knowledge bases (RAG), evaluations, observability
- **Just ask Claude** — Documentation written as AI context; ask questions, get answers, start building
- **Balanced** — Comprehensive yet customizable; not too minimal, not too opinionated
- **Fork-friendly** — Take what you need, customize what you want
- **API-first** — Actions accessible via versioned API endpoints, MCP server, and agent capabilities — ready for agents and integrations

## Agent Orchestration

Resparkable ships with a complete AI agent orchestration layer. Admins design, configure, execute, and monitor AI agent systems from `/admin/orchestration`; consumer-facing chat is exposed via `/api/v1/chat` and an embeddable widget.

What's included:

- **Agents** — Configured AI personas with system instructions, model selection, temperature, budgets, and attached capabilities
- **Capabilities (tools)** — Function-calling tools that agents invoke; ships with built-ins (knowledge search, memory, pattern lookup) and a 4-step pipeline for adding custom tools
- **Workflows (DAGs)** — Multi-step pipelines with 15 step types: routing, chaining, parallel branches, RAG retrieval, human approval gates, error strategies, templating
- **Knowledge bases (RAG)** — Document ingestion (MD, PDF, EPUB, DOCX), chunking, embeddings, and pgvector semantic search scoped per agent
- **Multi-LLM providers** — Provider abstraction with fallback chains, model registry, and cost tracking
- **MCP server** — Model Context Protocol integration so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can use your agents and tools
- **Embed widget** — Token-authenticated, CORS-aware chat widget loadable into any site
- **Scheduling & webhooks** — Cron-scheduled autonomous runs and event-driven triggers
- **Evaluations & A/B experiments** — Named-metric scoring (faithfulness, groundedness, relevance) and variant lifecycle
- **Observability** — Execution tracing (OTEL plug-in), conversation export, audit log, approval queue, dashboard analytics

Built on the 21 agentic design patterns from _Agentic Design Patterns_ by Antonio Gullí.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (local, Docker, or hosted)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise.git
cd resparkable

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

## Generate BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# Edit .env.local with:
#  - your DATABASE_URL
#  - your BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

# Install dependencies (will error if the database url isn't valid)
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:migrate:dev

# Start development
npm run dev
```

Open <https://resparkable.test> to see the app. The port is `PORT` in the committed
`.env.development` (**3016**), which `npm run dev` reads — see
[`PORT`](./.context/environment/services-env.md#port).

The `.test` hostname comes from the shared HCE dev proxy, which maps
`resparkable.test` → `127.0.0.1:3016` through Laravel Herd. It is how several
Resparkable-derived apps run side by side without anyone remembering which owns
which port, and it makes dev cookie behaviour match production instead of
lumping every app onto one `localhost` origin:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:human-centric-engineering/dev-proxy.git
cd dev-proxy && ./apply.sh          # idempotent; --dry-run to preview
```

**The port lives in that repo's `apps.json`, not here.** Change it there, re-run
`./apply.sh`, and update `.env.development` to match — the two have to agree or
the proxy points at nothing.

`http://localhost:3016` still works if you would rather skip the proxy, but set
`BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local` to whichever origin
you actually use. A mismatch there is the usual cause of auth redirecting into
nothing.

> **Google sign-in does not work on `.test`.** The TLD is reserved and Google
> rejects it as an OAuth redirect target, so dev logins on a `.test` hostname
> have to be email/password. Sign up at
> [`/signup`](https://resparkable.test/signup) — on a fresh database that account is
> promoted to `ADMIN` automatically (see below).

### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up                                    # Start app + database
docker-compose exec web npx prisma migrate dev       # Run migrations (first time)
```

### First admin account

Resparkable ships **no default login credentials**. On a fresh database, the first
account you create — sign up at [`/signup`](https://resparkable.test/signup) — is
automatically promoted to `ADMIN`. Every account created after that is a regular
`USER`.

> `npm run db:seed` provisions a non-login `system@resparkable.local` user that owns
> the seeded orchestration configuration. It has no password and cannot sign in;
> it does not count as the "first account", so your first real signup still
> becomes the admin.

## Essential Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm run validate         # CHANGELOG + Node version + type-check + lint + format (Prettier + Prisma)
npm run db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio
npm test                 # Run tests
```

## Optional Features

These work without configuration in development and can be enabled for production:

- **Email** — Console logging in dev; configure Resend for production. See [`.context/email/`](./.context/email/)
- **Analytics** — Console provider in dev; configure PostHog/GA4/Plausible for production. See [`.context/analytics/`](./.context/analytics/)
- **File Storage** — Local filesystem in dev; configure S3/R2/Vercel Blob for production. See [`.context/storage/`](./.context/storage/)

## Documentation

- [**CUSTOMIZATION.md**](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) — **Building on Resparkable**: the fork/app onboarding guide — extension model, package.json policy, staying in sync with upstream
- [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — Contributing changes back to Resparkable itself
- [**.context/substrate.md**](./.context/substrate.md) — Full architecture and reference docs
- [**.context/orchestration/meta/functional-specification.md**](./.context/orchestration/meta/functional-specification.md) — Agent orchestration: full system inventory and capability spec

## Just Ask Claude

Resparkable includes comprehensive documentation in `.context/` written specifically as AI context. Instead of reading through docs, just ask Claude:

- _"How do I set up S3 for file uploads?"_
- _"What are the password validation rules?"_
- _"Add a new API endpoint for user preferences"_
- _"How does authentication work in this project?"_
- _"Build me an agent that searches my knowledge base"_
- _"Add a capability so my agent can call the Stripe API"_

Clone the repo, start Claude Code, and start building. Claude already knows how Resparkable works.

### Enhanced Capabilities

Install the Next.js DevTools MCP server for real-time diagnostics and browser automation:

```bash
claude mcp add next-devtools npx next-devtools-mcp@latest
```

See the [Next.js DevTools MCP docs](https://github.com/vercel/next-devtools-mcp) for details.
